## Claude Sonnet 4.6 - Product Overview

Claude Sonnet 4.6 is a hybrid reasoning model with superior intelligence for agents, featuring a 1M context window. The model delivers frontier performance across coding, agents, and professional work at scale.

## Key Capabilities

### Coding and Development
The model excels at the complete software development lifecycle, from planning through debugging and large-scale refactors. It demonstrates strong reasoning across multi-file codebases with precise implementations and minimal iteration cycles.

### Agent and Autonomous Systems
Sonnet 4.6 offers superior instruction-following and tool selection for autonomous workflows. It handles complex multi-step tasks requiring sustained coherence and adaptive decision-making, making it suitable for customer-facing and production-grade AI systems.

### Computer Use
The model navigates digital environments with greater accuracy than predecessors, reliably handling browser-based tasks from competitive analysis to procurement workflows. It approaches human-level capability in spreadsheet navigation and multi-step web forms.

### Enterprise Workflows
It processes high-volume professional tasks across finance, research, and business operations -- analyzing financial data, synthesizing insights, and generating polished written content.

## Pricing and Access

Starting at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, with savings of up to 90% through prompt caching and 50% via batch processing. Available on Claude.ai, the Claude API, and major cloud platforms including Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud's Vertex AI.

## Performance Highlights

Early users report preferring Sonnet 4.6 over its predecessor 70% of the time in coding scenarios, with notable improvements in context-awareness and code consolidation. Customers even preferred it to Opus 4.5 roughly 59% of the time, citing superior instruction-following and fewer false success claims.

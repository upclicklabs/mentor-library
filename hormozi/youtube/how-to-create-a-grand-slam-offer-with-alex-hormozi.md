# How To Create A Grand Slam Offer with Alex Hormozi

to be able to develop that i know this transition a bit into the grand slam offer because i feel like the offer is the way to at least communicate what you're trying to solve um and i wanted to transition there because we made that promise of telling a bit more about it my question would be this is that if i'm out there and i'm basically i feel like i'm selling the same thing as everybody

else right and i know we talk a lot about that in the book um what is the mistake that's happening because a lot of people let's say i'm starting an agency maybe i'm a consultant maybe i'm a coach or maybe i'm in the workplace and i'm working a job that's similar to everybody else and i feel like the way to you know excel is maybe to do just a

little more than everybody else at the same price or maybe to be a little cheaper than everybody else and provide the same value but i know you look at this very differently and you introduce something fascinating around the grand slam offer so a saying that i have it's not in the book but it's marketing is about different business is

about better and so and you said a very key point is that the offer is the way that we communicate the value that we're going to deliver right because we haven't delivered it yet we're just communicating the value and so having a a grand slam offer will get tons of people to say yes to you then the problem is delivering on the

promise right but those are for me i would rather choose to have a delivery problem than have a demand problem it's much easier to fix a machine that's got electricity going through it rather than have a machine that has no juice going through it then try and speculate about what's wrong with it so i'd rather figure out what does everyone really want and then figure out a way to

deliver on it you know and one of the ways you know the process that i take people through the book is first off you'll probably need to charge more than you currently are number one number two you probably need to have a less scalable business model in the beginning and that's okay because what we're doing is you're going to get paid to do r d right my less scalable business like and

so i'm i'm preaching a trajectory that i followed right and it's also a trajectory that i've seen so many other uh you know very successful entrepreneurs follow which is everyone has this rocky cut scene that no one talks about right these great marketers spent four years cold calling doing door-to-door sales stuff that no one talks about i spent i sold 4 000 gym

memberships before i ever taught anyone how to sell right and so i knew what i was talking about because i had done it so many times but it wasn't it wasn't very glorified at the moment right i was just selling a lot but i didn't realize that my work was working on me more than i was working on it and so the the the the first step i just said right you probably need to charge more

than you are the second is you probably need to have some sort of done for you component where you're going to provide more than you normally would and just go above and beyond third is you want to solve every single problem that your that your prospect has and if you don't know what they are that's why we do this really in depth kind of chapter in your business career

like how did alex know how to fix so many gyms so well well i spent two like not only did i have my own six in different locations but i turned around 33 of my own in black markets white markets latino markets brits poor east west uk canada like we went all over the place and i knew that okay in these markets this is we have to do a little different

and these markets they're a little bit like this and and i had to learn all these little nuances but then it just the tr the depth of the knowledge the roots were so deep it was really impossible to compare my experience to anyone else's and so most people just try and jump to like how do i make the offer better when reality is like how do i make me better so that when i make my

promise i know that i can deliver on it right and so the the kind of last step of this is like how do i how do i solve all the problems which you know i put that within the vehicle of the bonuses right it's like how can i solve every single problem or rather perceived problem that the prospect is has or believes they have

and then how do i how do i reverse all risk to them right how can i make how can i create an unbeatable guarantee and my kind of thinking around the guarantee is especially when you're starting out you almost want to make a guarantee that you're scared of and i say that for two reasons one because you'll sell more people two because if you're scared of it then

you're going to work your ass off to try and fulfill on it and i think that if you raise that level of what you're promising you just it will force you to level up because a lot of people sell like how to make money and i'm like well what if you just guaranteed that they make money they're like well i couldn't do that i'm like well why not

that's the reason you don't make money like that that's why you're not making money like the average the average you know in our licensing and just for everyone who knows like that's one of seven businesses that we're a part of it's it's that's kind of how we started our journey as the fitness and i tell more of those stories

because in some of the other companies i was able to jump like five steps ahead but like we kind of walk through every one of these steps with that business like the average gym that worked with us added 240 000 a year in top line that's average that was the average you know the average gym uh 3.1 x their profit they went from 29.50 a month and

take home to 8 900 a month and take them net of our fees on top of what we what we we build right and so if you have that level of deliverable right on average then you will make a lot of money and that's really what it comes down to like like like if you if you can deliver on a promise and deliver something that's very valuable where people don't

have to have lots of effort and sacrifice which gets into the value equation right which i put inside the book you will be rewarded by the marketplace [Music] you

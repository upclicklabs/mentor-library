# More Articles Are Now Created by AI Than Humans

## Key Takeaways

- AI-generated articles have surpassed human-written articles in quantity published online
- The proportion of AI content has plateaued since May 2024
- Despite prevalence, these articles largely don't appear in Google and ChatGPT results
- The study didn't evaluate AI-generated/human-edited hybrid content, which may be more common

## Motivation

Following ChatGPT's November 2022 launch, companies have explored LLM-generated content as a cost-effective publishing strategy across search, social, and advertising channels. Research indicates AI-generated content is as good or better than content written by humans in many cases, with audiences often unable to distinguish the source.

## Results

As of November 2024, AI-generated articles exceed human-written articles in publication volume. Growth accelerated dramatically after ChatGPT launched, reaching nearly 39% of articles within 12 months. However, this growth has since stabilized, remaining relatively constant over the past year — possibly because AI-generated articles do not perform well in search.

## Methodology

**Data Source:** 65,000 randomly selected URLs from Common Crawl, filtered for English-language articles with schema markup, 100+ words, publication dates between January 2020 and May 2025.

**AI Detection:** Used Surfer's AI detector with 500-word chunks, classifying articles as AI-generated if >50% scored as such.

**Accuracy Testing:**
- False positive rate: 4.2% (pre-ChatGPT articles)
- False negative rate: 0.6% (GPT-4o generated content)

## Limitations

The study excluded AI-assisted/human-edited content and only evaluated GPT-4o outputs, potentially underestimating actual AI prevalence across different models.

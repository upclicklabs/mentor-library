Why social listening matter more than ever The way and places where we
search online have changed. We've evolved from short, broad queries to
question and answer-based queries that are more specific to our needs.
From "best laptops" to "what's the best laptop for a kid just starting
college." Before, these searches were almost exclusively on search
engines like Google or Bing. There'd be the top results, and maybe some
links for direct buying options. Now, if you do this search on Google,
you'll be met with an AI Overview that summarizes the results for you,
removing the need to sift through article after article. And if you're
like the 58% of consumers who have replaced traditional search engines
with AI platforms like ChatGPT, you're getting a whole new experience
--- one that's a dialogue. This shift is happening quickly, so for
brands to keep up, they need to adapt. I use AI as a recommendation
engine and 58% discovery tool, especially for media (e.g. books, movies,
games, anime, music, artists, new media of consumers have content
creators) and for resources (e.g. textbooks, replaced traditional
courses, tools, websites, etc.). As an example, I search engines with AI
gave it a list of books in my library and asked if for product recs
there were any books that I might also like. of consumers have replaced

The evolution from SEO to AEO Traditional SEO is built and strategically
attuned to the old way of searching --- a broad, short query on a search
engine. As the mode of searching is evolving for many, a new strategy is
needed from marketing teams: Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). To reach
the consumers turning to AI for their answers, marketing teams are now
required to consider LLMs as a target audience of sorts to make sure
their content is discoverable. It's happening so quickly that in a
recent study conducted by Webflow, 93% of marketing leaders agree that
AEO will be important to their company's success in the next two years.
And while almost half of teams (45%) are already testing AEO tactics,
there's still widespread uncertainty about what exactly will work, with
42% of practitioners calling AEO a "moving target" and expressing some
apprehension about the future. Since AEO is about building a content
strategy structured on answering the questions of your core audience,
it's vital to identify what those questions are. The solution? A defined
social listening strategy to follow where real conversations are
happening. Online communities like Reddit offer a rare view into the raw
and unfiltered conversations that influence decision-making. 45% of

Harnessing the power of community and conversation To understand those
conversations in a meaningful and scalable way, brands need access to
where people are talking, not being talked at. With over 100K active
communities and 116M+ daily unique visitors1, Reddit is one of the
largest, most intent-driven archives of raw human dialogue. Here, people
don't scroll passively--- they come to ask, compare, vet, validate, and
share their own experiences. In fact, roughly 40% of all posts and
comments on Reddit are product-related, because people use the platform
to figure out what to buy, what to avoid, and what actually works in
real life. Reddit is inherently commercial Reddit answers product
questions like search, and engages with perspectives like social

That makes Reddit one of the most inherently commercial environments on
the internet; not because brands lead the conversation, but because
people do. They come looking for solutions, stories, social proof, and
perspective, and they do it long before they land on a brand's site.
Until now, most businesses have only been able to observe these
conversations from the sidelines. Reddit wanted to change that. Free
tools like Reddit Pro give businesses a structured way to listen, learn,
and participate organically in the conversations that influence real
buying behavior. Reddit Pro allows you to: ● Show up where your
customers make decisions with Reddit Pro: Everything you need to find,
engage, and grow your customers on Reddit --- all for free. ● Discover
what your customers are saying about you on Reddit: Discover your
audience and top trends by tracking keywords and phrases like your
business, products, competitors, and more. ● Establish your most
authentic home on the internet: Set up your Reddit profile in minutes:

conversations about your business. ● Engage your customers where they
make decisions: Engage directly in conversations, connect with fans, and

your post & comment performance -- from upvote rate, to views, and more

The key insights from social listening It's no secret that marketing
teams are in a constant battle to get more data and act on it. In
particular, as Google experiments with their approach to third-party
cookies, more and more teams have prioritized collection of first-party
data (information collected directly from audience members). First-party
data helps marketing teams break out of a proverbial bubble or echo
chamber of ideas and cuts straight to the point to see exactly what
users want from a brand. Places like Reddit provide some of the best
insight here because users are inherently more honest in what they say.

How to incorporate social listening into your marketing strategy Whether
it's positive feedback, inventive use cases, or a less-than-flattering
competitive comparison, the first-party data from social listening
doesn't do much if you're not incorporating it into a larger marketing
strategy. Social listening ultimately sheds light on trends in your
community that highlight brand perception strengths and opportunities.
Once you've collected this data and identified the key takeaways, you
have to look at your marketing channels and where to start making
updates. Social listening's cross-functional impact Your website is the
most comprehensive digital channel to explain who you are, what you do,
and how you solve problems for your customers. It's where you have the
most ownership over how your brand is perceived. Learning tone and
emotional cues from social listening help tailor how your brand can
present itself. Product use cases and hacks can inform product or
platform pages. Emerging topics and competitive intelligence can feed
your content strategy to directly answer posed questions, increasing the
likelihood of appearing in answer engine searches. With Webflow Analyze
and Optimize, you can take the insights from your social listening
strategies and experiment quickly to personalize your web experiences at
scale. Amplify your message with Reddit Ads today. Spend \$1,000, get

Social listening's cross-functional impact (continued) There's a stark
difference between saying what you think customers should hear and what
they have said they want to hear. That's where social listening and
content marketing meet in the middle. Emerging topics, feedback, and
audience discovery can help direct content strategy and identify what
topics are best to invest time in explaining more thoroughly. A core
piece of traditional SEO and now AEO is authority. Traditional and AI
search engines prioritize content from sources that have proven
trustworthy and authoritative in various topics. Reddit, in particular,
thanks to strict guidelines and a system of topical approval among
users, ranks highly for Google and LLM searches on a regular basis. With
so many users answering questions directly and receiving validation from
their peers, search engines trust this content. Incorporating Reddit
topics into your owned channel strategy as well as Reddit activity of
your own is a great way to have impact on both fronts. Reddit is the #1
trusted source for both humans & LLMs Amplify your message with Reddit

Social listening's cross-functional impact (continued) Once released,
your product is open to interpretation in usage as much as your
messaging is --- just look at Pedialyte. Looking at user-generated
content (UGC) channels like Reddit is an excellent way to see what's
working, where users are finding bugs, how competitors are winning or
losing, and what is requested to make the product even better. For top
brands today, the "listening" in social listening is quickly followed by
some talking of their own. Social channels are excellent opportunities
to engage directly with users in a natural way. Don't pitch your
solution or tell them they're wrong. First, listen to the conversation,
then add value to either inform, educate, or accept feedback. Once you
join the conversation, we have solutions designed to drive reach, grow
share of voice, and maximize performance. Awareness Consideration

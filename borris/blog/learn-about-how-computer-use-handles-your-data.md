# Learn about how Computer Use handles your data

## What Computer Use Is

Computer use represents a beta feature enabling developers to direct Claude to interact with computers by interpreting screen content, moving cursors, clicking, and entering text. It's currently available only to commercial Anthropic API customers.

## Data Processed

When activated by users, the system collects:
- Screenshots from the computer's display that Claude uses to interpret and interact with the interface
- User inputs and outputs
- No additional data beyond these elements

## Data Usage and Training

For commercial products (Claude for Work, Anthropic API):
- Inputs and outputs are not used to train models by default
- Exceptions exist only when users explicitly share materials or opt into programs like the Development Partner Program

## Data Retention

Screenshots are automatically deleted within 30 days by default unless customers arrange different terms. Anthropic retains data to enforce its Usage Policy.

# How Fourthwall Increased Search Revenue by 936% in 9 Months

## The Challenge

Fourthwall empowers creators to monetize their brand while delighting fans. Founded in 2019, the platform serves over 50,000 creators selling products and building recurring revenue through memberships.

By 2023, Fourthwall had strong product-market fit and decided to scale distribution through SEO. The company possessed thousands of quality backlinks from creator partnerships and substantial domain authority, positioning them well for competitive rankings. However, they lacked the expertise to fully capitalize on this opportunity and sought a specialized partner.

## The Solution

CEO Will Baumann remained confident that SEO represented significant growth potential. The team implemented the Graphite Platform with three key initiatives:

### Improved Topic Selection with Topic Explorer

Fourthwall struggled with inconsistent article performance and difficulty replicating successes. Topic Explorer enabled rapid research and accurate traffic projections across entire topics rather than individual keywords. The Topical Authority score clarified ranking opportunities, while Graphite's recommendation algorithm systematically populated their content pipeline.

### Shifting from Guesswork to Science with Writing Assistant

The team lacked internal SEO expertise despite deep customer knowledge. Writing Assistant provided blueprints for success by identifying target keywords, suggesting terms, and recommending content structure. AI-powered content scoring helped them create pages that outranked competitors.

### Unlocking Programmatic Product Pages

Fourthwall's programmatically-built product pages had ranking potential but struggled initially. Graphite identified critical content gaps. Adding FAQ sections to address these gaps resulted in a 300% traffic increase. Baumann noted that without Graphite, they would never have known to include this information.

## The Results

**By the Numbers:**
- 1.47M increase in impressions
- 19.7K increase in clicks (2301% growth)
- 936% increase in search-driven revenue

Fourthwall established a repeatable system for consistent traffic gains translating directly into revenue growth. Baumann reflected that they jumped to a 9 out of 10 in SEO maturity in a matter of months.

The company plans to scale SEO investment significantly over the next 12 months.

# The ONLY Storytelling Formula You Need To Go Viral

If I had to bet on one thing that could guarantee your success as a business owner today, it would be storytelling. No doubt. Learning how to tell stories is the fundamental pillar behind any top brand [music] and personal brand you see today. You've seen brands relentlessly tell stories across the years. Take Nike or Dolby as an example. And right now, there is a storytelling framework that

is spreading across social media like wildfire. I've watched creators in completely different industries use the exact same structure and get millions of views and thousands of likes. So, I decided to put it to the test for 6 weeks consecutively and the results outperformed my usual content strategy by 3x. Accumulated over a million views just by using this format. And the best

part is I am seeing complete beginners and creators who were stuck at no views get thousands of views with it too. And honestly, this is an insane entry-level way to storytelling. No one has time to read all of these storytelling books on how to tell stories to tell stories to other people that tell stories. I mean, I didn't and I know you don't have time either. So instead, I analyzed those who

were telling stories well and realized that what makes this format and ultimately all stories work on social media today isn't just about following an old school framework. It's actually all about understanding key parts of your story and connecting them back to one key person, [music] your reader. They need to become the focal point of your story. Good stories are never about

you and always about them. This is exactly why the POV format blew up across YouTube, then Instagram, and it can even be replicated on written first platforms like LinkedIn. Because think about it, this creates a character that your audience immediately connects with themselves. Every single successful POV stories is about the audience, [music] their potential, and the creator showing

them what's actually possible. A thing that I noticed that most people actually get wrong about storytelling is that they always start with them. Common storytelling like post on LinkedIn sounds something like this. I am happy to announce that I got a promotion at a company that you've never heard of. Okay? Or something like I woke up at 5:00 a.m. and journal for an hour. Okay?

But now, if you were to use the POV format, this allows you to tell the exact same stories via a different lens, which completely flips the psychological dynamic of how your audience consumes your content. Instead of them being a passive observer of your life, they become an active character in their own transformation story through your own story. And this is amazing. Just think

about it. in basic content marketing principles. There are three core pillars being recited by the industry consistently. Educate, entertain, and storytell. [music] This format does all three simultaneously and easily. If we were to break it down, you basically educate by using the POV angle to link it to your journey and leaving a key piece of

insight or education. If the one insight is excellent, the post has done its job in the education front. Then you storytell by creating this narrative arc that has a clear beginning, a transformation, an outcome. And if you pair it with the right images that emphasize the key parts of the journey, your job here is done. Now, lastly, we have the entertainment pillar in written

form. This is often the hardest to crack for most people because how could you possibly make a piece of text entertaining for someone? Most people think that entertainment can only come from videos, images, or memes. But in written form, you can actually do it using something else. Rhythm. Rhythm in your lines. Let me show you. If I pull out every single one of the POV posts

I've written over the last 6 weeks, you can notice something similar. The lines are strategically longer and shorter with spaces in between for a reason. They all flow like a song. They become easy to digest. To achieve this, all you need to do is mix a combination of short, long, and medium length sentences to keep the reader reading. And I could talk about rhythm and flow for ages

because this has personally been such a key part of my journey as a writer and a creator. But instead, to save you and me time, I'll leave you with this example that emphasizes it well. Landing pages today are formatted in a very similar way because researchers noticed that humans don't actually read content, they scan it. There is this thing called the F-shaped reading pattern. Eye tracking

studies show that when people look at content online, their eyes move in an F shape. So basically, people scan the first line horizontally, then they scan down the left side vertically, then they scan another line horizontally onto about halfway down, and then they go back to scanning vertically down to the left. And if we follow exactly how the eyes are moving, you can literally see

the letter F when you map out the heat zones of where the eyes go. And this is why the first few words of every single line that you actually write are absolutely critical because if they don't hook the reader, then they'll never read the rest of your post and you won't be able to educate them, entertain them, or inspire them. All right, so now you've got the context. Let's get into

the how to actually implement all of this information. Let's go. Now, let's say that you and me want to write the typical LinkedIn I am so happy to announce post I reacted to earlier, but in a POV way. The way I'd rewrite it would be POV, you get your dream tech at 27. Easy. How you need to be thinking about POV stories is by asking questions about what you've actually been doing.

If you got your first high ticket client, then the POV would be POV. you landed your first high ticket client on LinkedIn. Here's how. What I really want you to focus on is that there is always an angle that we can take from our own stories through a public lens or a shared sort of belief. Look, the entire point of storytelling is to be interesting or at least try to become

interesting in the process. And so to do that, you need to be doing interesting things. Write about them, do more interesting things, and see the results in your storytelling. By adding the POV angle, you remove the selfishness to the post and it becomes something your reader's brain can actually feel. The moment someone reads POV, you are their subconscious mind goes, "Wait, that's

me." And suddenly they are locked in into your story. They have to keep reading because they think that the story is literally about them, especially if the first line resonates. Now, on screen here, I've got three of my favorite POV posts that I've written over the last 6 weeks. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to explain exactly how each one of them was thought

of to a topline level. And then at the end, I'll show you exactly how you can write your own one in seconds, literally right now. So, we have my favorite three. And this one was actually the first time I tried it, and it got nearly 2,000 likes and 60,000 impressions. Now, the second one got over a 100,000 impressions on LinkedIn and nearly 3,000 likes. And the third one got nearly

200,000 impressions and 2.6,000 likes. And so, I know this works because I've seen it multiple times for myself and I'm going to show you someone else that did this incredibly well on screen right now. Now, let's start with the similarities each one of them have, which is the hook. POV, you woke up on January 1st and decided to change. POV, you're

building a sevenf figureure online business in Dubai. And then POV, you're building a business in Austin with your friends. These three posts share the exact same hook but in different ways. You can see POV, you are building a business. POV, you are building a business. POV, you are doing something new. What I'm doing here and the reason why this worked is because on LinkedIn,

most people are actually trying to build a business or they're actually trying to work in a business that they love, right? So I am tapping into total addressable markets because I know that most people on LinkedIn are doing that exact same thing. The next thing that I'm optimizing for is this. So here I mentioned friends and awesome which means travel and then friendship which

then taps into fundamental values that people actually care about wealth health and relationships. And in this one I am actually covering all three health wealth and relationships because for most people changing actually can mean either of those three things. So when you go ahead and write your own, think about how can I tap into bigger markets with a single sentence. You talk about

things that everybody actually cares about, which is again friendship, making more money, building a business, changing, taking a leap or a transformation or even travel. Now the body of every single one of the posts is actually quite similar even if it tells a different story. So here I say at 23 I did this, at 24 I did this, at 27 I did this. And then statistically I had a 3%

chance of making it and a 0.1% of making building a profitable business. So what I'm doing here is that I am continuing the storytelling arc but I'm still trying to relate to my reader because I know that a lot of people reading this right now are either unemployed and young and ideally at the end I want to mention something aspirational without bragging. So if you see how I've

actually manufactured this post basically is I am going from low to high. I'm not starting with a crazy high and then I keep continuously going high high because that is very braggy and we want to avoid that. We want to make it aspirational by being relatable. And so even if I'm talking about big numbers like building a sevenf figureure business, I then go back to how I

started which makes this a lot more aspirational and relatable because it's simple. Hey, I was where you are. I am now here, but I understand the gap that you need to fill and I'm going to tell you exactly how I did it so you can do it, too. And then I end the post with something like a reminder that makes them feel good. So, I like to think about this like a Pinterest quote or a

platitude that makes people remember the post, makes them not feel too overwhelmed by the amount of information that I'm telling them, but they remember the feeling that they got when they read it. This post also follows that exact same narrative. POV, you're building a business in Austin with your friends. So, hey, I am traveling the world, building businesses with my friends in

the USA. I know you guys know I'm from London. So, that to some people is aspirational, being able to travel around the world with your friends while building a business of your dreams. But then again, I go back down to where I started. And again, the reason I'm doing this is so I can go head-to-head with people that have not achieved that exact same outcome, but they aspire to do so.

So, I said, "Not long ago, I was just an invisible freelancer posting on LinkedIn to try and land a client." What does this do? It's relatable. I'm not bragging. I'm literally saying I was where you are right now. And then after those two short sentences, I can move ahead and transcend time in the storytelling framework. So it doesn't take me far too long to tell a simple

story. Because what people do wrong with storytelling is that they try to give too much detail. What I try to do instead is to give as little detail as possible while this maintaining an emotion and a strong feeling and a lot of reciprocity. So what I mean by this is, hey, I'm giving you some inspiration. and giving you some motivation and giving you one simple tip

so you can do this as well. All I'm going to ask for you is for you to finish reading this entire post and maybe like it if you liked it. That's what I mean by reciprocity. I personally liked how I wrote this entire post because it was short, concise, it told that entire story, but then it finished with a piece that a lot of entrepreneurs don't actually talk about, and that is

how much work it actually takes to build one business, let alone three. So, I said, "I've had little sleep for over the last few months, but I've never felt more alive." which then taps onto another emotion which is the entrepreneurial spirit. So essentially you need to understand your audience well enough to understand what cards you need to play in order to make them feel

something and relate to you. I know that I have three types of audiences. I know that there are the entrepreneurs who are exactly where I am at. I know that there are the aspirational entrepreneurs who want to do something like me or I know that there are the CEOs and like really cool founders that have been in my exact situation. So again, I am tapping into a larger total addressable market because

I am tapping into a single emotion that can be felt by three types of different people. And then again, I finish with three key lines that actually make this a feelgood post. The proudest I felt in a long time. Thank you. And this is just the beginning. almost like a finishing piece of a Marvel movie or a Harry Potter movie that makes you feel like you want to keep on watching the next

films. You know, now that I've explained exactly what my thought pattern was behind these POV stories and the framework that I actually used, you can also see the one thing that I haven't said, which is the image use. This is incredibly powerful, especially when storytelling because we are using written form. So, we need to actually use another element to obtain as much

attention as we possibly can within 3 seconds. And that can be using a photo or multiple photos. On LinkedIn, you have the option of using photos. And I use this every single time I post because I know that this maximizes my chances of my post being seen and therefore read. So, when storytelling, ideally, you want to add a photo that is immediately related to what you're

talking about. So here I said I'm building a business with my friends in Austin. So here I am in Austin with said friends looking like we're building a business. So you can see the laptop, you can see the nicotine spray, you can see the hats, you can see the whiteboard. And what this is doing is something that no one on LinkedIn talks about. And I'm tired so I'm going to explain. Giving

context to people is essential for your success as a storyteller because in the most simple form you are able to eliminate many many words and long sentences by simply having them on site in your photos. This is key. So I don't have to say that I traveled that I had a hoodie and that I was tired and that I had my laptop and that I was with my co-founder Rob and my other co-founder

Jake because they can see them. I don't have to say it. Context is key. So then if I give them visual context, I don't have to verbalize it unless it's important. But the things that I do verbalize are things like I am building a million dollar business. They cannot see the million dollars, but they can see me acting like a founder. They can't immediately tell that I'm in Austin, but

they can tell that I'm somewhere sunny. So it is important for me to sort of like add those piece of context so I don't have to overexlain myself. People can also make their own assumptions and have a little bit more fun looking at the images and truly make it seem like it's a story from a movie that they are watching. Essentially, this type of storytelling, I try to call it the

tiktoication of LinkedIn where by seeing things, you assume things and then you actually want to stay on the video. When you're looking at a trend video with audios, etc., you're looking at different things like this girl dancing to this really cool trend or this person doing their makeup or this person you know breaking something down that has a lot of graphs. So like you are

interested because of that one thing and then you stay for the rest when you understand the context. On LinkedIn, you get to do exactly the same thing, but without having to have a videographer following you for a YouTube vlog that's a POV video or a Tik Tok where you have to sit down and edit it for hours and pick the right music, pick the right sound effect. And you don't even have to

pay an editor to edit your Tik Tok with subtitles, etc. Like, you can just do it with photos and text, which is essentially free. And here's where I truly rest my case on LinkedIn being one of the most powerful platforms because you don't have to spend that much money to actually become good at it and then being known, then seen, then viral, then gaining thousands of followers because

you only have to write good content and have good photos. All right, analysis done. Now, let's write the script or the post together for the first hug that I actually showed you. So, the way I'm going to do this is via using AI. And the tool of choice is going to be Cleo. Cleo is honestly the best AI tool in the market when you're trying to minimize failure and you're trying to write

outstanding content on the platform. I'm going to be leaving the link for Cleo down below in the description if you want to try it. And also, if you are enjoying this video, please subscribe to this channel. These videos take me hours to script. They take our editors hours to edit because I make so many mistakes. And it would make me really, really happy if you subscribed because I do

enjoy making these videos. But I don't have that much time anymore cuz I run three businesses. So please, if you want to see more of these, subscribe so I can hit 100K and get a nice black and then show it to my mom. Thanks. Bye. So I logged on to Cleo. I clicked on swipe files and you can see my saved swipes which I can save from anywhere like Twitter, Tik Tok, Facebook, even

LinkedIn as well. So what I've done is I saved my favorite POV post that I've written. So you can also see them. And what happens here is that once I save them, they save onto my personal swipe file, but they also save onto the local swipe file. So, you can see everyone else's favorite posts that they've taken from multiple different places for inspiration, too. The idea here is that

you get to save your favorite post when you're scrolling around on social media, so you can then reference them later and use them when it's time to write your next post for social media. >> [music] >> So I not only get to see my own saves, you can also see thousands of posts that have been saved by Cleo users. So it's basically like a live trending library

filled with content other people liked but also you liked. And this is essentially what I call the inside of a marketer's brain but without the years of learning to be honest. So now let's say I want to write exactly like I just wrote my other POV post. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select the post that I liked from my swipe file. So, I'm going to go to my swipes on

here. I'm going to add them here and then here. So, you can see me selecting both of them. Now, I've checked that my posts were on the swipe file. So, I'm going to go on this little toggle here with the plus. I'm going to go to my swipes and then I'm going to select the POV post that I just recently saved. So, I know one of them is about transformation. I know one of them is

about breaking generational poverty and I know the other one is about building a sevenfigure business. So, you can also title them so you can find them easily. And essentially, this is going to help Cleo understand exactly what you want your post to look like, sound like, but it will add your own context that you're going to give it. So, for example, I love this POV angle.

Give me 10 ideas like this for my consultancy business. So, ideally, follow the prompt that I just inserted, you'd actually just add your business or replace it with your niche. Or if you have something more specific, you can also add it. Please be my guest and do that. What Cleo is doing here is that its AAI is able to research internally from your

content and web content with similar ideas to yours and it will connect the dots where information may be lacking. So let's say you said to it that you've sold a 50k high ticket deal, but it doesn't have any other context. So what Cleo will then go and do is that it will try to find the right references that make the most sense and then it will create the post based on that and its

intuition and also the hundreds of prompts we've built it with. So the content is as specific and excellent as it could possibly be. So here you can see that Cleo has given me ideas and then has written the first part of the post as if I had written it which is amazing. It's analyzed the pattern and trends and it also knows you. So it will write very specific stories if you are a

user. So now I love all of the ideas. I selected one of them and then I click on the button to draft the post and then you can see here it's generated a full post based exactly on the prompt that I gave it and based exactly on the information that it has about me. So POV you just turn down a client for the first time. Once the draft is done, you can edit it, write with it going back

and forth like an assistant or even get it to generate you new lines of text. You can of course do this manually as well. You can copy and paste the same post onto Chat GBT or Claude and then give it a similar prompt and use a similar editing process like I just did. You can see by the final output of Cleo, the post is practically ready for you to post, schedule and add images like I

just did. Now, after learning everything about the POV storytelling framework that I love using and even using AI to write it, you may have three questions. Number one, what if I don't have any interesting story to tell? Number two, will this POV format get old? Everybody's using it now. And then number three, how often should I use this format? Now, let me go through

every single question one by one so you can leave this video and actually start doing the thing without being scared of any other consequences. Now, the answer to question number one is simply, look, everybody has a story to tell. Your boring life to someone else is the number one thing that they wish that they were doing. And if you still don't believe it, then try and tell stories

until your life becomes storyw worthy. Look, my life didn't always look like this. And I'm certain every single person I've highlighted in this video or on the examples also didn't. The biggest difference between those people that are telling really cool stories now and those that don't is that the people that do have stories told the same stories that they had until they got the stories

that they wanted to tell. The simple conversation that you had on the train with someone or with a client is a story. The new thing that you just learned overnight for a client or at school is a story. The small challenge you overcame you think no one cares about is a story. And to be honest, let me prove it to you. Let me prove that anything can be a compelling story. So,

in the comment section right now, give me three things you think might be storyw worthy, and I'll write you an entire LinkedIn post for you to use it, or you can even use it as a script or as a newsletter. This is a challenge from me to you because any story is actually compelling if you know how to write it. Well, I am personally going to be doing this for the first few people who

comment and are subscribed to this channel. So, leave the comment down below, leave the three things, and I'll write you a great story using this POV framework. Trust me when I say this, the stories you think are boring are exactly what someone else needs to hear right now. All right. Now, answer to question number two. The powerful thing about viral formats is that they may get old,

but not for you if you own them. Formats don't die because they get popular. They die when they stop working psychologically. What actually happens when a viral format gets old is that the story being used is being overused. Everybody's telling this exact same story and then it loses its touch and its magic. So as long as you keep on writing new stories or with a different

lens, then you'll remain at the top. For example, the POV format is over a year old now and it hasn't died because it plays into imaginary situations you, me, and the reader wants to live or is currently living. And so as long as humans have aspirations and want to see themselves succeeding, this format will always work. And also there are infinite ways to execute this. I've seen POV

posts about productivity, relationships, [music] business, fitness, parenting, cooking, traveling. So this format adapts to literally any niche or any topic. So you can always recreate it as many times as you wish. So if you pivot from talking about B2B SAS to entrepreneurship to then lifestyle, then the format remains fresh. In essence, this is really not

about it getting old, but it's all about can I tell stories that actually matter to my audience? Now, finally, question number three, how often should I use this format? Well, once a week is ideal if you're doing it on LinkedIn. It gives you the chance to test and iterate and also use the other remaining posts of the week to educate on the [music] POV topic. So for example, let's say that on

a Monday you pick a POV post that is about you building a business and how your life is 10 times better. The [music] post after should be exactly about how you built it step by step. So now on screen you can literally see how I would execute this from a POV standpoint and then turn it into an educational post. The effectiveness of this and any other storytelling

framework is all about using the right strategy. So if you aim to not make your audience bored of the exact same story and you help them, then you are becoming useful and unique, not just another person talking about themselves consistently. And what this is really doing, if you think about it, is that you're inspiring, you're educating, and you are entertaining all at once and

every single week. All right, so I actually created an entire template that you can copy paste right now. It's going to be on screen. I actually try to read it out loud where I sound kind of silly. So I'm just going to leave it there until I finish speaking right now. So you can screenshot it, copy paste it, and start writing. Okay, ready? Done. This template has generated millions of

views across thousands of posts. But I must say templates are just like training wheels. Once you understand the psychology within the writing, you can actually start breaking rules and create your own variations, which is my goal at all times when teaching something. So let me recap all of this. I gave you the framework. I gave you the template. I gave you the psychology behind why all

of this works. And I gave you a tool to speed the entire process up. The only thing left is perfect execution. And that's where most people fail. Not because they don't know what to do, but because they don't put 100% in. If you want to master this type of storytelling format, then all you need to do is follow the exact steps and almost mimic the way these posts are structured. From

the literal hook to the structure of the lines to even the images used, do your best to find the photos that match your story best. And always, always, always try to keep your cook short and concise and less than eight words, please. Your audience is out there right now scrolling through LinkedIn looking for someone who understands their struggles and can show them what's possible and

that literally could be you. Because let's be honest, people are not looking for another I am happy to announce post. They are not looking for another humble brag. They are looking for someone who can help them see themselves winning. That someone could be you. Now, if you're a business owner, an entrepreneur, or even a creator, and you want more tactics like this, then you

should join my private mentorship program on content, branding, and online business that has been used by over 3,000 entrepreneurs. Or even better, you can also join the wait list for my four-week program where we enroll a select group of founders every single quarter. Oh, and by the way, I almost forgot to say if you want an entire breakdown on how I went from zero to

nearly 250,000 followers on LinkedIn, then I recorded an entire breakdown for free for you to watch right now. See you there. Bye.

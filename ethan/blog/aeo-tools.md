# AEO Tools - Answer Engine Optimization

## Overview

The landscape of artificial intelligence search has transformed significantly. ChatGPT answers did not previously have clickable links. Now, ChatGPT has prominently displayed clickable links, maps, and other traditional search elements.

This shift has generated substantial interest in Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). Over 50 companies have begun developing AEO tools to help brands adapt to this evolving space.

## Key Features and Pricing

The primary capability across AEO platforms centers on tracking AI-generated answers. Many vendors are beginning to develop additional functionality including optimization capabilities, brand analysis tools, and citation measurement systems. However, these supplementary features remain nascent compared to tracking capabilities.

## Strategic Recommendations

When evaluating AEO solutions, consider these guidelines:

- AI tracking represents the primary useful feature among all available tools
- Optimization tools and advanced functionality remain underdeveloped across the sector
- Focus primarily on AI tracking and use the least expensive tool that completes the job you need
- Monitor emerging features as vendors evolve and assess whether upgraded capabilities justify switching platforms

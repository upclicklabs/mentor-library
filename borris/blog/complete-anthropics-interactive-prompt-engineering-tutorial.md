# Complete Anthropic's interactive prompt engineering tutorial

## Welcome to Anthropic's Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial

### Course Introduction and Goals

This course is intended to provide you with a comprehensive step-by-step understanding of how to engineer optimal prompts within Claude.

**After completing this course, you will be able to:**
- Master the basic structure of a good prompt
- Recognize common failure modes and learn the '80/20' techniques to address them
- Understand Claude's strengths and weaknesses
- Build strong prompts from scratch for common use cases

### Course Structure and Content

This course is structured to allow you many chances to practice writing and troubleshooting prompts yourself. The course is broken up into **9 chapters with accompanying exercises**, as well as an appendix of even more advanced methods. It is intended for you to **work through the course in chapter order**.

**Each lesson has an "Example Playground" area** at the bottom where you are free to experiment with the examples in the lesson and see for yourself how changing prompts can change Claude's responses.

**Note:** This tutorial uses Claude 3 Haiku, Anthropic's smallest, fastest, and cheapest model. Anthropic has two other models: Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus, which are more intelligent than Haiku, with Opus being the most intelligent.

This tutorial also exists on Google Sheets using Anthropic's Claude for Sheets extension. The Google Sheets version is recommended as it is more user friendly.

When you are ready to begin, go to `01_Basic Prompt Structure` to proceed.

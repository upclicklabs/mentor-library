# AB Tests Show That the Internal Links API Increased Daily Impressions by 42% After 50 Days

## Executive Summary

Graphite evaluated an internal linking tool for a no-code platform through controlled experimentation. The test group showed marked improvements in visibility metrics over a 50-day period, while low-traffic pages benefited most dramatically.

## Abstract

The study examined 199 URLs divided into test and control groups between November 29, 2022, and January 10, 2023. The test group (99 URLs) implemented the Internal Links API, while the control group (100 URLs) remained unchanged.

Key findings indicated the test group achieved a 6.4% increase in average daily clicks and 42.4% in average daily impressions compared to baseline performance.

## Methodology

Researchers stratified URLs into quartiles based on traffic volume:

- **Quartile I:** Lowest traffic (0-25%)
- **Quartile II:** Low-medium traffic (25-50%)
- **Quartile III:** Medium-high traffic (50-75%)
- **Quartile IV:** Highest traffic (75-100%)

This approach enabled comparison between high and low performers and revealed how implementation impact varied by existing traffic levels.

## Results

**Overall Performance:**
- Test group: +6.4% clicks, +42.4% impressions
- Control group: -8.3% clicks, +0.7% impressions

**By Quartile:**

Quartile I showed exceptional gains with 172.4% increase in average daily clicks and 767.4% in average daily impressions, though one outlier URL drove much of this growth.

Quartiles II-IV showed more modest increases ranging from 1.9% to 14.5% in clicks and 9.9% to 11.3% in impressions.

## Key Observations

The dramatic Quartile I improvement was heavily influenced by a single URL that increased from 10.1 to 112.8 average daily clicks. Excluding this outlier, Quartile I still showed 23.2% increase in average daily impressions, but a decrease of 13.1% in average daily clicks.

## Conclusion

Results suggest the Internal Links API can substantially boost visibility within 50 days, particularly for underperforming content with minimal existing traffic or link coverage.

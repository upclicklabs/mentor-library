# Shopify_AI Commerce at Scale: The Agentic Commerce Platform

**Published:** January 11, 2026

## Overview

Shopify announced a strategic expansion into AI-driven commerce, introducing infrastructure that enables merchants to sell directly within AI conversations across major platforms. The initiative centers on making commerce seamless within conversational AI interfaces.

## Universal Commerce Protocol

Shopify, in collaboration with Google, unveiled the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)—an open standard designed to facilitate transactions between AI agents and merchants. The protocol addresses diverse retail requirements by supporting multiple connection methods including REST, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and Agent Payments Protocol (AP2).

The UCP enables AI agents to manage critical checkout functions: customers can input discount codes, provide loyalty credentials, select subscription preferences, and confirm transaction terms directly within conversations.

## Integration Across AI Platforms

**Google Integration:** Shopify merchants gain access to native selling capabilities within Google's AI Mode in Search and the Gemini app. A new Direct Offers pilot allows select merchants to present exclusive deals within these AI interfaces.

**Microsoft Partnership:** An updated Copilot Checkout integration enables merchants to facilitate purchases directly through Microsoft's Copilot assistant.

**Expanded Reach:** These integrations, managed centrally through Shopify Admin's Agentic Storefronts feature, complement existing ChatGPT integrations.

## The Agentic Plan

Shopify introduced a new pricing tier opening Shopify Catalog access to non-Shopify merchants. This democratizes AI commerce access, allowing brands using alternative platforms to leverage Shopify's product infrastructure for sales across AI channels and the Shop app.

## Industry Endorsement

Over 20 retailers and platforms have already endorsed the UCP, signaling broad industry support for this standardized approach.

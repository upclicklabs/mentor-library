# Your AEO Checklist for Brand Visibility in ChatGPT, Gemini &amp; More | GROW Europe 2025 | HubSpot Live

Number one on our AO page checklist, put the answer first. The first sentence should answer the primary question completely because answer engines are looking for that quick validation that they're in the right place. So, here's what that looks like. The most effective way to prioritize sales leads is by using a lead scoring system that ranks contacts based on their fit

and engagement. The lead is not buried, folks. Okay, the next best practice. Your page should then go a click deeper. And this looks like two to three short paragraphs that are going to expand on your answer with context, definitions, methodology. This will signal to answer engines that your answer is credible and complete.

Number three, reference original data throughout. Answer engines are looking for net new information to site, which you can provide in the form of stats, original data, and case studies. This doesn't need to come from expensive surveys. Usually, when I talk about original research, people get kind of a weird look on their face and they're like, "Oh, we don't have a ton of

budget. How are we going to do that?" Use your CRM, hopefully your HubSpot CRM. Again, talk to your customer success and sales teams for original insights. Kip Bodner, our CMO, who is here today, uh, got this insight from talking to our marketing and sales teams about how they improved our own lead scoring systems. This was a very inexpensive original insight for us to

provide in this blog post. Number four, include an FAQ. At the bottom of every page, you are going to answer at least three sub questions, each with its own mini direct answer and short explanation. So, a micro version of how you framed the overall page. And you're going to format each one of those questions with its own H3 or H4 heading with the goal of

getting AI to really easily find and lift it. And these FAQs are also a great way to optimize for fan out queries. You can basically knock out three to four at once. Number five, add structure up the woo. Answer engines are lazy readers. So, it's kind of like when I say I read an article and I actually mean that I watched a Tik Tok. So, you want to make

your content as easy to understand as possible with bullets, super explicit headers, tables, structured lists, anything but walls of text. Number six, make sure each section can stand on its own. Answer engines don't actually read pages. They read things in passages. It's called chunking. That's literally the technical term, which always reminds me of, you know, what

your dog does when it's not feeling well. Which means for you that every section needs to make sense, even if AI hasn't read the section before or after it. All comes back to this concept of lazy reader. Here is an anti-example from a little newspaper you might have heard of, the New York Times. It's a pop quiz, requires audience interaction. What do

you think Mr. Strawmire is talking about here? And you can just shout answers out. >> Sandwich. >> Sandwich. Okay, it's pretty good. Any other guesses? A wrap. Okay, you're pretty clued in. These are good guesses. Okay, as long as you have that crunchy thing in the middle and you know

how to fold it, you can put anything in there. So, you're circling around the idea. The answer is a crunch wrap. For anyone who has never had the glory that is the crunch wrap, it is like the Greg sausage roll for Americans. I did use ChachiBT to find that reference. I hope that's close. [laughter] But if a human is going to struggle to understand Mr. Strawmire's reference

about context, an answer engine is certainly not going to be able to. So when you are creating content, when you are reviewing content, literally give it the Taco Bell test and make sure that every section can stand on its own. I've saved the best for last, which is why there is a helpful little sparkle emoji next to it. Number seven, tie every point back to the product.

You need to reinforce to the answer engine why your product is relevant to the topic so that it knows to recommend you. If you simply give answer engines educational and original insights without tying those insights back to your product, you are making them smarter without reinforcing why that concept is relevant to your brand and therefore why you should get a

recommendation. So this part is key. [snorts] Tie every point back to the product. And that means you're going to have a one-two punch. Here is some good content to get your attention. And here's why that topic is deeply connected to what my product can do. There should be a product reference in every paragraph, every other paragraph. It's that many

product references. Okay, you can now optimize a page for answer engines.

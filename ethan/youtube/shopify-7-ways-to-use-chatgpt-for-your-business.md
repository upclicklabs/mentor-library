# 7 Different Ways To Use ChatGPT For Your Business

From the Learn With Shopify YouTube channel. Host: Michelle Bailey.

## Overview

This video covers seven practical ways business owners can leverage ChatGPT to automate tasks, save time, and grow their online business. It also includes a bonus section on GPT-4 capabilities.

## 1. Level Up Your Spreadsheet Productivity

ChatGPT can make tedious tasks within Excel or Google Sheets quicker and more painless. It can teach you how to perform specific spreadsheet operations and generate formulas on demand.

**Example**: If you have a list of customers with first and last names in a single cell but want to separate them, you can ask ChatGPT for a formula. It generates an accurate response within seconds — faster than searching the internet for a definitive answer.

## 2. Write Job Descriptions

Whether hiring full-time team members or freelancers from platforms like Upwork, ChatGPT can write professional and friendly job descriptions tailored to your specific requirements. It saves significant time on wording and professional formatting.

## 3. Write Content in Multiple Languages

For businesses selling products or services internationally, ChatGPT can both translate existing content and create new content from scratch in any language. This applies to product descriptions, marketing emails, about us pages, and more.

**Example**: Create a 90-word sustainability-focused statement about a mattress brand, then translate it for Spanish-speaking customers — seamlessly and instantly.

## 4. Write and Debug Code

For business owners who need to make custom website edits but aren't coders, ChatGPT can write code from JavaScript to Python. It can also debug broken code by pointing out exactly where errors exist — saving hours of manual error hunting.

## 5. Create Lead Magnets

Lead magnets are free, useful resources that attract prospective customers. ChatGPT can help create downloadable booklets, guides, and other content that serves as a hook for new customers.

**Example**: For a nutrition business, ChatGPT can write an entire week's meal plan under 800 calories, which can be branded and offered as a free download on your Shopify site. Works for fitness, food, fashion, gardening, and more.

## 6. Negotiate Tactfully

ChatGPT can help craft strategic, respectful, and rational negotiation responses. It provides clear principles of negotiation and can draft actual emails to send to suppliers or partners.

**Example**: Negotiating with a supplier who wants $2 per unit when you can only afford $1 — ChatGPT provides negotiation principles and writes a ready-to-send email.

## 7. Write Email Marketing Content

ChatGPT can write catchy marketing content including email body copy, fine print with dates and exceptions, subject lines, and preview text. The content can be copied directly into email service providers like MailChimp or Klaviyo.

## Bonus: GPT-4 Features

GPT-4 (available to Plus members) offers significant upgrades:

- **Smarter**: Scores higher on complex tests than previous models
- **Bigger prompts**: Can output responses with over 25,000 words (vs. ChatGPT's 3,000 word limit)
- **Image inputs**: Can identify plants, insects, dogs, locations, and outfits from photos
- **Visual shopping**: Upload a photo of an outfit and GPT-4 provides links to similar items within your budget
- **Language identification**: Can identify languages from text or images
- **Appraisals**: Can estimate value of antiques, collectibles, and even car damage

## Key Takeaway

ChatGPT is a free, powerful tool that business owners should leverage to automate tedious tasks and grow their business. The combination of AI tools with a Shopify store gives entrepreneurs an "army of superhuman robot workers" at their disposal.

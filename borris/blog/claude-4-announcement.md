# Claude 4 Announcement

Anthropic introduced two new flagship models: Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. These models establish new benchmarks for coding capabilities, complex reasoning, and AI agent functionality.

## Core Models

Claude Opus 4 is described as the best coding model with sustained performance on lengthy, intricate tasks and agent workflows. Claude Sonnet 4 significantly enhances the prior Sonnet 3.7 version, delivering superior coding and reasoning with more precise instruction following.

## Key Announcements

### Extended Thinking with Tool Use (Beta)

Both models can leverage tools -- including web search -- during extended thinking phases, enabling Claude to alternate between reasoning and tool utilization for improved outputs.

### New Model Capabilities

- Parallel tool execution
- Enhanced instruction adherence
- Significantly improved memory capabilities when developers grant local file access
- Models can extract and preserve key information to sustain coherence across extended tasks

### Claude Code General Availability

Following positive research preview feedback, Claude Code now includes GitHub Actions background task support and native IDE integrations with VS Code and JetBrains.

### API Enhancements

Four new capabilities enable developers to construct more sophisticated AI agents:

- Code execution tools
- MCP connectors
- Files API
- Prompt caching lasting up to one hour

## Performance Metrics

- Claude Opus 4 leads on SWE-bench (72.5%) and Terminal-bench (43.2%), demonstrating sustained performance across multi-hour task sequences.
- Claude Sonnet 4 achieves 72.7% on SWE-bench while balancing capability with efficiency.

## Pricing

- **Opus 4**: $15/$75 per million tokens (input/output)
- **Sonnet 4**: $3/$15 per million tokens (input/output)

Both models are accessible across Claude.ai, API platforms, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI.

# Debunking The Myth That Search Is Dying

## Main Argument

The article argues that the widespread narrative "SEO is dead" is fundamentally false, built on flawed research methodologies rather than solid data. The author contends that organic search traffic has declined only slightly, contradicting claims of dramatic 25-50% decreases.

## Key Claims and Data

**SEO Traffic Reality:**
- Organic search traffic decreased only -2.5% year-over-year, not the claimed -25%
- Traffic to search engines increased +6.9% from 2019-2020
- Traffic has been relatively flat since 2023, with slight increases in 2025

**Search Engine Visits:**
- Google traffic grew +0.8% in 2025
- Overall search engine traffic increased +0.4% in 2025
- Google visitors remained essentially flat (-0.3%) comparing 2025 vs. 2024
- Q4 2025 visitors to Google grew +1.35% compared to Q4 2024

**Differential Impact by Site Size:**
- Top 10 sites actually increased traffic (+1.6%)
- Middle-tier sites (top 100-10,000) experienced the largest declines
- Smallest and largest sites generally saw increases

**Category Variations:**
News, health, cooking, and entertainment saw drops exceeding 10%, while clothing, shopping, and marketplaces increased.

## Methodology Critique

The author criticizes competing studies for relying on flawed research methods:

**Survey Problems:**
- Self-reported surveys fail for quantifying past behaviors due to unreliable human memory
- Frequency illusion creates false perception of prevalence
- Selection bias skews samples toward early LLM adopters
- Question wording significantly influences responses

**Small Sample Issues:**
Studies examining fewer than 20 sites cannot represent broader market trends. Anecdotal evidence from tech communities misrepresents general population behavior through availability heuristic and false consensus effects.

## AI Overviews Impact

Contrary to dramatic claims, AI Overviews:
- Decrease click-through rates by approximately -35%
- Appear only 30% of the time (not 50% as some claim)
- Primarily target informational keywords rather than high-value commercial searches
- Appear on 13% of branded keywords versus 25% of non-branded terms

AI Overviews has replaced Featured Snippets, which used to appear 20% of the time, suggesting less disruption than assumed.

## Paid vs. Organic Balance

- Organic results receive approximately 90% of clicks from Google
- Paid search traffic increased +2.1%, a minimal shift
- Organic traffic remains approximately 10 times larger than paid clicks

## Data Validation

The author validated Similarweb data against first-party sources (Google Search Console, Google Analytics), finding median Pearson correlation of 0.86, considered very high. Google's March 2025 announcement of more than 5 trillion searches annually aligns with Similarweb's 5.7 trillion calculated pageviews.

## Disclosed Conflict of Interest

The author acknowledges being CEO of Graphite, a growth agency that offers services focused on SEO, creating financial incentive to argue search remains a valuable channel. This transparency allows readers to evaluate potential bias.

## Broader Context

The article frames the "search is dying" narrative as driven by:
- Speculation rather than rigorous data analysis
- Availability bias among early LLM adopters in tech communities
- Overestimation of LLM adoption beyond early-adopter demographics
- Misapplication of qualitative research methods to quantitative questions

The underlying thesis: while search has experienced modest changes, particularly affecting mid-tier publishers in certain categories, the channel remains fundamentally healthy and widely used.

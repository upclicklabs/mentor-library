# Shopify Agentic Plan: Sell Directly in AI Channels

## Overview

Shopify has introduced the Agentic Plan, a commerce solution designed to enable merchants to sell products directly within AI chat platforms and conversational interfaces. This represents a fundamental shift in how ecommerce operates — moving from storefront-based discovery to AI-conversation-based discovery.

## Key Features

### Connect Once, Sync Everywhere

The platform allows merchants to surface real-time product data to ChatGPT, Google AI Mode and Gemini, Copilot, Perplexity, the Shop app and more. This streamlined approach eliminates the need to manage multiple separate integrations. Set up your product data once, and it distributes across every AI channel.

### Integrated to Your Stack

The Agentic Plan integrates with existing business systems, including PIMs (Product Information Management) and tax systems, while enabling order routing to established order management systems. This design maintains compatibility with current operational workflows — you don't need to rebuild your tech stack to sell in AI channels.

### Your Brand, Your Narrative

Merchants gain control over product and brand content presentation through a Knowledge Base app. This lets you manage what questions buyers are asking about your products and provide answers about returns, shipping, and more. You control the narrative that AI agents use when representing your brand.

### Turn Conversations into Conversions

The platform enables direct purchasing within AI chat environments using Shopify's secure, industry-leading checkout. Customers can discover, evaluate, and purchase products without ever leaving the AI conversation interface.

## Why This Matters for AEO

The Agentic Plan is essentially Shopify's infrastructure answer to the AEO shift. Instead of optimizing content to get cited by AI (the content strategy side), this provides the commerce rails — letting AI agents actually complete transactions on behalf of merchants. It bridges the gap between AI visibility and AI-driven revenue.

## Key Implications

- **AI channels become direct sales channels**, not just discovery channels
- **Product data structure matters more than ever** — AI agents need clean, structured data to represent products accurately
- **Brand control in AI contexts** is now possible through the Knowledge Base feature
- **Checkout friction disappears** when purchases happen inside the AI conversation
- **Non-Shopify brands can participate** — this opens the ecosystem beyond existing Shopify merchants

## Current Status

The Agentic Plan is marked as "Coming soon," with an invitation to join a waitlist for early access and availability updates.

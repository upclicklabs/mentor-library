# Take an in-depth course on getting started with MCP

## Introduction to Model Context Protocol Course

### Overview

This comprehensive course teaches developers how to build Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients using Python, focusing on MCP's three core primitives: tools, resources, and prompts.

### Course Description

The course provides extensive coverage of MCP architecture, explaining how it shifts tool definition and execution burden from your server to specialized MCP servers. Students learn the transport-agnostic communication system and complete request-response flows from user queries through MCP clients to external services.

### Key Learning Objectives

Students will master:

- MCP architecture and how it integrates with Claude AI
- Message types used between clients and servers
- Building MCP servers using Python SDK with decorators instead of manual JSON schemas
- Document management functionality with tools for reading and editing
- Using the built-in MCP Server Inspector for browser-based testing
- Defining resources for read-only data exposure
- Implementing resource reading with proper MIME type handling
- Creating prompts for pre-crafted instructions
- Understanding when to use each primitive: tools (model-controlled), resources (app-controlled), and prompts (user-controlled)
- Practical integration patterns including autocomplete and context injection

### Prerequisites

- Working knowledge of Python programming
- Basic understanding of JSON and HTTP request-response patterns

### Target Audience

Developers looking to create MCP servers.

The course is offered as free instruction through Anthropic Academy.

# Practice applying prompting techniques to real-world scenarios

Welcome to Anthropic's comprehensive real world prompting tutorial. This course is designed for experienced developers who have already dipped their toes into the world of prompt engineering, particularly those who have completed the comprehensive [Prompt engineering interactive tutorial](https://github.com/anthropics/courses/blob/master/prompt_engineering_interactive_tutorial/README.md). If you have not gone through that tutorial yet, it is strongly recommended you do so before continuing, as it provides an in-depth exploration of various prompting techniques with hands-on exercises.

Across five lessons, you will learn how to incorporate key prompting techniques into complex, real world prompts. It is recommended that you start from the beginning with the Prompting recap lesson, as each lesson builds on key concepts taught in previous ones.

# AI marketing Masterclass: From beginner to expert in 60 minutes

You are in for a treat. Today we have a vibe marketing lesson by the one and only the Boring Marketer. And today he shows exactly how you can use MCPs, skills, and Claude Code to build incredible assets like ads and lead magnets. So we go through a live building exercise of how you can do it. And the people that stick around to the end of the episode are just going to be able to use Claude Code for vibe marketing. I think that a lot of people have done vibe coding and they're putting out products. They want people to come to those products. So, how do you get them? Well, you do things like vibe marketing. You use AI agents to do the work for you. Enjoy this master class on vibe marketing.

We are blessed to have James Dickerson, aka the Boring Marketer, aka Mr. Vibe Marketer, aka the guy I go to whenever I'm trying to automate anything with marketing and AI. Welcome to the show. James, by the end of this episode, what are people going to learn? I want to show you how to use AI, specifically Claude Code, to create a complete marketing system in one sitting. So, we're going to go through how to use skills, how to use some MCPs. I've been playing around with some new tools that I want to show you today, and it's just going to be loaded with value. And at the end, we'll have some stuff to give away here. So, I come bearing free gifts on this episode for the listeners and the viewers as well.

And by doing these tactics, the hope I assume is getting more customers, generating more revenue, leads. Yeah. I mean, you know, like you open up X, you open up social media and YouTube, and there's so much stuff about like building, which is awesome. You know, I love building. I love getting in these tools, but ultimately we want to figure out how to get customers and generate revenue with the things we're building. And you know what's really powerful about the systems that we're going to go through today is that they exist in the same place where you're building your products and you can get your marketing work and your product work done in the same place and leverage skills and MCPs and agents to do it.

All right, let's give it a shot. So, I'm going to be hopping around between a couple different things. First off, I've got sort of a guide that I created for the episode and we're going to start there just to talk about some principles. I want to make this kind of clear in terms of frameworks and how I think about this stuff and then we'll get into the nitty-gritty, but I think it's important to kind of set the stage a little bit. So, I'm going to share my screen here just for a little bit of context. I sat down yesterday for like 2 hours and recorded myself working in Claude Code. I made a video. I tried to extract everything. I narrated everything with Whisper Flow. I had Claude Code create a full session transcript where I built a complete marketing system in a sitting.

And the whole reason that I'm doing this, you know we got together, was it last week? It feels like it was already like 3 weeks ago. We got together last week. We kind of talked about like, hey, what are we working on for the year? What's our big priority? And one of the things that you and the guys told me was, "Hey, you need to work on your funnels and your traffic and figuring out ways to generate consistent signups, results, etc." So, I was just really meditating on that for a few days. And yesterday, I sat down and I built this out. And you can take what I'm doing here and make it your own. I'm just going to show you what I did.

So, let's start with this playbook that I created. And this is going to be my lead magnet. And for those that are kind of just getting started or whatever, you build a product, you want to collect an email, you want to nurture a relationship often before you ask for the sale. You and your team are awesome at funnels and lead magnets, Greg. I've learned a lot from you all. So, I kind of took some of those learnings into this and I sat down and recorded a session and I turned that into the lead magnet with Claude Code.

So, often times creating lead magnets is a pain. Like I've sat down and I've been like, "Oh man, how do I do this? I don't want to write an ebook. I don't want it to sound like AI." But I transcribed everything and that's what created this entire guide. So, here's what's inside. And remember, I used AI to create this. So, we're going to start with kind of the foundation, how you need to think to start using tools like Claude Code for marketing. We're going to go into some core frameworks. We're going to talk about skills. It's very important to doing this the right way. We're going to talk about how you can stack skills to get really good results out of AI. We're going to go through a few different use cases of how you can do that. We'll cover four niches. We'll do SaaS, ecom, consulting and agencies, and then info, education, and creators. We'll talk about how to drive traffic into your funnel. We'll show how you can build this, and then we'll talk about some ways that you can get started quickly.

So, all right. I created this entire lead magnet with Claude Code, and creating these has always been like a pain for me. I've learned a lot about lead magnets and funnels from you and your team. So, based on what we were chatting about last week, it was time to put it into action. So, what I did, I recorded a 2-hour session of me just doing vibe coding and vibe marketing in Claude Code. And I took the transcript, I took the logs, and I extracted the frameworks and how I think, how I prompt, how I stack skills together to build marketing assets that actually generate revenue. So we'll cover kind of the foundation, the philosophy, how I think, what the tool stack looks like, some core frameworks, how to use skills the right way, some use cases for various niches. I've got info education creators, consulting and agencies, ecom and SaaS examples here. We'll talk about how to drive traffic and then we'll go through some quick start ideas for how folks can get started here.

Okay, so most people come into an AI tool and they start prompting and they expect a great output. I spend a lot of time doing research upfront. I use the Perplexity MCP. I won't talk about how to set that up today, but it does a great job going out there, finding deep information on your market, who the competitors are, what the angles are that are missing out there that you can go and attack. So really three layers here. I start with research, MCPs, Perplexity. I crawl websites. I use Playwright to open up websites in the browser to get inspiration. And then I kick in the skills. So the skills are actual marketing frameworks. And just a reminder of what skills are, they're essentially the way I think about them are instruction manuals for your agent of choice. So, I use them in Claude Code and I train them deeply on certain tasks that I want to get done, whether it's direct response copywriting or coming up with ad ideas or writing long form content. So, I built 17 of these skills that I use every day.

And then lastly, you're kind of building and putting all these together. So, the tool stack that I use here, I've got my IDE, Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code. I've been using Whisper Flow to narrate a lot lately. I have my research MCPs and then I use the skills and a couple other ones to start creating assets. So, we're going to go in and just start vibing and I'll show you how I use all this stuff in real time and I'll give you a view of some things that I've created for my own funnel.

Here we are. So the Perplexity MCP, let's just take a made-up use case. Let's say that I want to start like an AI marketing agency or something along those lines. So I'm just going to enter a prompt. You know what? Let's narrate this. I'm starting an AI marketing agency and I want you to use the Perplexity MCP to go and research who the main players are and give me an idea of what the gaps are in the market.

Yeah. Why would you use your hands like a simpleton? Exactly. Once I started using Whisper Flow, I feel like I was in the stone age before. So, this is going to take a little bit of time to go out and do some research. You can see that it'll use the MCP here with a prompt to go out and find out like who are they targeting, what's the landscape look like, who are the main players, all of that good stuff. So we'll get that data into our system here and Claude Code can use that for context. Again, I'll spend like an hour sometimes doing research with Perplexity, crawling websites, getting as much data as I possibly can about my market.

Which I think a lot of people miss, right? Yeah. A lot of people miss that part. They hop in and they just start trying to create stuff and that's where the AI slop thing comes from, you know? They just go into a tool, they throw a prompt in, they get an output, they throw it out there, and then they wonder why am I not getting good results? They're skipping kind of the boring research step often times. All right, so normally I would wait for this to go out and load, but in the meantime, we're just going to fire up another instance here and we'll keep working as that's doing some research.

I'm going to enter in a prompt and we're going to assume we have that research. We can come back to it and I'm going to start using some skills. Okay. I'm starting an AI marketing agency targeting boring local businesses that do $2 to $10 million a year in revenue. I feel like they're overlooked. I want you to use the positioning angles skill to find out how we can optimally position our company. Now for those wondering about skills, you can create your own skills. You can say hey Claude Code I want to create a skill around finding an angle for my company just like I did. Now what I do is a very deep research process using Perplexity, using Firecrawl, using all these data sources to build my skills. I include world-class references in there. I review them by hand to make sure that they are good and they have kind of all my taste built in. You can follow that same process to do it on your own as well for whatever needs that you have.

So right now it is loading the skill and I always invoke this skill within my prompt. Claude Code can also pick it up if needed but I typically call it out. All right. So create an MD file with this and save it. Cool. So we've got a bunch of really good angles right here from our skill. So again, this has positioning frameworks and things like that built in. And here's what we've got. So step one, the transformation. So what does a plumber, HVAC company, etc.'s life look like after working with you? So it's trying to talk about what's the transformation we can give these companies and what it came up with is from chasing work to selecting work, from hoping the phone rings to controlling when it rings. And you know if you've ever been in the service industry, that's a big unlock when you can turn the dials and do that yourself so I think that resonates kind of on a deep emotional level.

All right so competitive landscape, like it's doing all this research on what's the emotional framing and the transformation, what's the competitive landscape look like, what's the unique mechanism here that you can attack. So for instance what makes AI marketing for boring businesses different: AI responds to leads quickly in minutes not hours, in home services first response wins 35% of jobs, volume without headcount, not having to pay a traditional agency $5 to $10,000 a month, getting weeks of work done in days. These are all things that this positioning angle skill sort of discovers. So the anti-agency, the speed weapon, the boring business specialist, the unsexy gold mine, the revenue ceiling breaker, and these are all things that you can also kind of codify into frameworks that you can use down the line in your funnel, which we'll review too.

So, I'm just going to have it pick its best one. Or actually, let's try this. Okay, you're Greg Eisenberg. You're an expert at finding positioning angles and niches. So, I'm going to let you spin up a task-based agent for that request and analyze this information and choose the one that is going to work best for us.

Just put me out of business live. Is it going to do that to me? I thought we were friends. Well, it only captures a little bit of your brain. Just a taste. I don't know because I've got, you know, 700 plus videos on my YouTube. So, it's got a lot of my brain on there.

Yeah. So, why spin up one of these task-based agents? So, typically when I have a conversation going, sometimes I stop after I use a skill and I have a checkpoint, if you will. So, I'll spin up a fresh context window within Claude Code with a task-based agent with a specialized job or role to kind of review that research and find me the one that it recommends. I find better results when I do that. All right, so it's doing the task. We've got our research file saved over here as well.

Some interesting white space opportunities that it came up with in the Perplexity research. So vertical specific AI agents, measurement and outcome guarantees, operational AI transformation, pragmatic implementation, regulated industry compliance, workforce capability building. It's got some competitive but emerging niches that you could go after, SEO, GEO, etc. And then it kind of talks about what's very saturated and what you should avoid. So that's all super helpful when you're building a marketing funnel.

All right. So, the winning angle: Boring Money. Cool. So, essentially, we've got phase one, Boring Money newsletter and podcast to celebrate boring businesses making real money. It's ideating like some kind of membership or peer group. And then, it looks like, oh, okay, Greg, it used how you think with ACP here to create a new offer idea. Actually, there you go. I like it. And also Boring Money. I do like that name.

All right. We want to start an agency though. So, we're going to take the "get weeks of work done in days and avoid the traditional agency timelines and costs." Based on that positioning angle decision, I want you to begin to think about some direct response copy concepts that we could place on our landing page. Use the skill.

And do you often have two instances? Is that your kind of go-to? Sometimes I do. I kind of did that here because Perplexity was taking some time and I wanted to keep moving. I'll do that at times. Like you could have one focus on research and using MCPs. Those can fill up context pretty quickly. So sometimes it helps to keep that in a split terminal and then do other work side by side. So you can save research, save files here that you're gathering from the third party tools and then you could use your skills and sort of execution in a separate terminal.

So, I trained this direct response copy skill on the greats of copy and direct response. So, I looked at like Eugene Schwartz and Claude Hopkins and all of these classic copywriters and then I sort of updated it for today's world, today's internet, and made it somewhat elevated so that it captures kind of a solid brand voice. So, it generates great copywriting. I've used it for all of my websites and it produces some really good results. So, okay, like we have some copy here. We're just going to keep going in the interest of time, but let's see. Use the Playwright MCP to find an agency we would compete with. Capture some screenshots of their website.

So can you just talk about Playwright and where you use it, how you use it? Yep. So Playwright is browser automation and when you use it in an MCP, it allows Claude Code to go and open up a window and do browser actions. So it can click through it, it can take screenshots of a website. It can get all of the information that you need, say for design inspiration or something like that. Let's say you're doing branding or you're doing design. You can easily access websites right here. So in the past before I used the Playwright MCP, my desktop was littered with screenshots and I'd take a screenshot, I drag it into Claude Code or whatever, but this really helps and it feels smooth. Kind of like when you're using it with voice, you can just kind of command what you want it to do. And you know, we're going out and analyzing competitors right here from a voice prompt. And is there a cost associated with that? Not with Playwright. So crazy, right? Playwright's open source and free. Yeah, it's crazy. Like to me, it's like a foundational MCP to kind of stack with these skills and stuff.

And what I found and what we're going to do next actually, we're going to use this MCP here to capture some screenshots and then we're going to use the front-end design skill from Anthropic on top of it. So, yeah, in terms of MCPs, I used to have tons of them set up and what I realized was that simple is often better. I have Perplexity, I have Firecrawl, I have Playwright. Those are my main ones. Perplexity does all the research tasks. Firecrawl can scrape websites. They just released this tool called Firecrawl Agent. So if you're like, "Hey, go find all the Facebook pages for boring local businesses and put it into a document," it can go and do those research tasks very accurately and provide the results for you right in Claude Code.

Yeah, I want to do a separate episode on just Firecrawl and all the opportunities and building businesses around it. So, people are into it. I'm into it. It's an awesome tool. No affiliation. They've done a great job. It's one of my go-tos. I use it almost every day. You know you've made it when you can say no affiliation.

All right. So, it is looking at the screenshots that we captured. It is analyzing them and we're going to get sort of an idea for our brand here that we can go and design a landing page for. So, here's a competitive intelligence summary. It looked at this major digital marketing agencies servicing these niches, kind of analyzed their messaging, all the copy, the key stats, etc. So based on the competitive intelligence and our positioning angle and our direct response copy, I'd like you to create a conversion optimized landing page for our agency using the front-end design skill.

So again, we've context loaded here. Like this is the very basic of the framework that I use every day and I've been trying to capture the thought process here and codify it. So again I cast a wide net. I use Perplexity. I come up with some unique positioning angles. I'll go and look at some individual competitors. I'll capture elements of their website, whether it's screenshots or copy or whatever. And then I'll fire up something like the front-end design skill to create a landing page. So, we're doing this live. I'll also show you how I did this for my entire funnel as well if people are interested in seeing that. I mean, I'm interested. Cool. All right, we'll do it.

All right. So, it's got a design direction and we talked about this on a past episode, the front-end design skill, but I have to shout it out again. This is from Anthropic. If you've ever done any vibe coding or working with AI, you know the patterns, the purple gradients, the rounded corners, the emojis, all of that. This is a skill or an instruction that helps to prevent all of the sort of AI elements in your design. And you can use it for websites, for landing pages, for applications, and it really does a fantastic job. Like every time I use it, I'm pretty wowed by it. So, it'll create a conversion optimized landing page for Boring Money with a distinctive anti-corporate aesthetic that stands apart from competitors like Scorpion. So, we want to stand out in the market. We've got a unique angle. We're going to have our own unique style, which is super cool.

All right. So, while that is cooking here, I'll show you the live versions that I've been shipping for the Vibe Marketer. I think what's cool about all this stuff is like before this stuff existed, you kind of created a business in a silo and now it was a lot more art back then and now it's a lot more science. I think what a lot of people want to do is they want to launch stuff that's going to have a high probability of it working.

Yeah. So like the fact that it uses the Perplexity MCP, the fact that you're doing real competitive research, the fact that you're automating that and you have the power of a $350 billion company Anthropic behind you is what fires me up.

Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So, here are, while this is working and designing, a couple examples that I'm actually using and designing some campaigns around as we speak. So, I created this landing page using the front-end design skill. People come here and then they get this playbook when they sign up. So again, I did all this research kind of on what are the opportunities within the AI and marketing space. So for each of those angles that I came up with I created a separate landing page. So I've got one for agency owners and consultants. I've got one for businesses that want to save money. I've got a landing page for folks that want to take on the work on their own like founders. So you can create these landing pages just with one prompt based on the positioning frameworks and then you can drive traffic into those and you'll see a much higher conversion rate since those are dialed to the exact audience that you're targeting.

Yeah, I think that's the big unlock. In the past we would create a couple landing pages and it would be a lot more artistic like I was saying, but now it's like no, we can do a hundred landing pages. Exactly. You could create a hundred landing pages and I'll also show you that you can create a hundred ads right here from Claude Code. So, that's a big thing that I want to show you today because it definitely gave me a wow moment when I was playing around with it earlier this morning.

Okay. But are these ads like AI slop looking ads or are they actually good-looking, gorgeous ads? You tell me. You want to see it right now while it's working? Yeah, I want to see it. All right. So, I saw a viral tweet from a company called Remotion. And Remotion creates videos and edits videos in Claude Code. And I was like, "Wow, that looks incredible." I hate trying to create videos. So, let's just watch this and you tell me what you think. Created a book, too. It's a nice touch.

What do you think? I mean, obviously it needs music. Yeah, it needs music. It needs music, but from a visual standpoint, it looks great. Yeah. And you can create it in the terminal, you know. So, there's a command, if you look for Remotion on X, they shared a free GitHub file that has all their prompts and stuff. I just used that to create my own version of it. But it can have custom fonts and brand colors and copy. I made that book image in Nano Banana Pro, removed the background in Canva, threw it into the terminal, and then it was able to go and implement that right on the video. So it also can create all kinds of different sizes and versions and all that. Like let's say you're creating a campaign for Meta and you need landscape videos, you need story format, you need square formats. It can do all of that programmatically and you could create a hundred videos with literally one prompt.

At a cost of... I didn't even subscribe yet. So that was free what you just saw there. At a cost of $0. It's mind-blowing.

All right. So let's see here. I think Playwright was running to kind of capture what Claude Code created so that it could self-review it. So as soon as it's done looking at it, we'll open up the link and have a look at our landing page. By the way, I used to hate the output in a terminal. But now I'm kind of obsessed with it. I love how simple it is. And I tried to use VS Code or whatever, there's a Claude Code plugin that kind of turns it into what you might feel online if you use Claude or something like that. But I don't know, man. I like this terminal so much. I came right back to this.

All right. So, we're going to open our link and we've got a landing page. So, I'm going to reshare my screen. We've got the copy. We've got the positioning here. And we've got a front-end design skill landing page created. So, "You've fired enough marketing agencies. Try the one that delivers in days, not months." AI powered marketing for plumbers, HVAC, roofers, and electricians doing two to ten million. See what we build for you. And yeah, kind of gets down to the nitty-gritty, talks about the differentiators. So, here's what it looks like for most trade businesses. The problem, the difference, the new way, kind of how you stand out, everything you get: lead response system, complete landing page, review generation, follow-up automations. Traditional agency, 6 to 8 weeks, 15 to $25,000. Boring Money, 5 days, a fraction of the cost.

So, why boring businesses? Within the direct response copy skill, I've got this sort of founder story section. So, "Every marketing agency wants to work with the next Uber, the AI startup, the DTC brand with a $50 million raise. You're doing $4 million in revenue with 15% net margins and zero debt. You're the most financially healthy business they'll ever meet, and they don't know how to talk to you." So I don't know. I really like some of the language here. I feel like it would resonate.

100%. This looks great. It doesn't look vibe coded at all. Doesn't have that purple vibe coded glow or anything like that. And I just feel it's a very confident page. Yeah. It's got confidence. Doesn't feel like your typical stuff. And of course, you could go back and forth and do a million different tweaks here if you wanted to. We're just kind of going with one shot to demo how to use MCPs, how to use skills to kind of get to something that'll convert.

So, let's go back to Cursor and we have our landing page. So, what's next? When people come to our landing page, what do we want them to do? So, I'm going to use another skill here. Actually, here's another cool thing. Use the orchestrator skill. I don't know what to do next. I know I want to convert visitors that come here. Maybe there's a lead magnet or something like that we can do, but I'm kind of confused as to what I should do next. So, a lot of people don't know what to do. But the good thing is you can also create skills that help you decide and orchestrate tasks for you across different skills. So in my skills I have an orchestrator skill that helps to prioritize and ask clarifying questions around what to do. So again to me this is just a case of the barriers just dissolving. You don't even have to know what to do. You don't even have to know how to do all this stuff. You just need to create the right skills in your environment and AI can guide you through the process.

So, walk me through when I should use the orchestrator skill. Like when you're confused or let's say you don't even know where to start. When I kick things off here, I'm like, "Okay, I need the direct response skill. I need a positioning angle skill," stuff like that. If you start with an orchestration skill, that can help you decide which ones to use and things. And again, I'm not pitching the skills I created here. You don't have to use mine. There's free skills out there. There's skill directories. You can search online and find skills. But if you open up Claude Code and you say, "Hey, I've got a bunch of skills here. I want you to analyze all the files and create a master orchestration skill to help me decide what I should do and which ones I should use in my project." That's a really good tip to help you navigate your way through here.

Here's what the orchestration skill came up with. So, let's map out where you are and what you're missing. What you have: positioning, a brand voice, a landing page. What you're missing: email sequences and a traffic strategy. So, this is actually exactly what I was going to call directly into Claude Code, but the orchestration skill knows the next step. It says without a lead magnet, you lose them forever. So, what skills next? We have a lead magnet skill. Let's see what it does. I can run the lead magnet skill right now to generate three to five concepts. Run it. Give me concepts and pick the best one.

Backing up, this is how I found my playbook idea using this lead magnet skill. It threw out workshop ideas, it threw out email sequences, it threw out PDFs and stuff like that. And I was just jamming with Claude Code. What's an easy way we could get this created? So, I decided to just record myself working, transcribe everything, and compile it into one of the recommendations that it came up with.

The lead magnet skill is running. The orchestration skill gave a couple ideas already. So it's going to pick one and then create the landing page section and the email sequence to support it. I mean, it knows what to do. It knows what skills to invoke. This is the magic of arming Claude Code with the right context and the right skills to do the job.

So are skills underrated or overrated? Well, I will say that not all skills are created equal for one. I think that if you are an expert in something, there's a unique opportunity to download your brain into a skill. And there's a big difference between, let's say Greg, if you created a skill on audience growth and audience building. There's stuff in there that I don't care who's using AI to try to build the skill, they won't be able to capture it. So I think a lot of skills get people partially there but that last 10 to 20% expert perspective that can get built in makes a massive difference in the output. That's just what I've seen so far. So, I think they're underrated. Honestly, they've been a game changer for me.

So, lead magnet concepts. We've got the Response Time Revenue Calculator, which is an interactive calculator that shows trade business owners exactly how much revenue they're leaving on the table due to slow response times. Concept two, "What Your Agency Won't Tell You" expose PDF. Concept three, the Five Minute Marketing Audit, a self-assessment checklist. And then we've got the Boring Business Marketing Playbook. I kind of like the audit checklist. It kind of feels like a tool and sort of gets them committed in a way. What do you think? Yeah, I agree. I think I'm always looking at stuff like this and I'm trying to make it tools basically. The perceived value goes way up.

Yeah, we're thinking alike with Claude here. Based on the skill, it also recommended the Five Minute Marketing Audit. It scored it, gave us the reasons why. So let's see what happens. Yeah, build the audit and put it on the landing page. Make it a modal in the bottom right part of the screen that someone can click and open up in a new browser window. If you didn't know that, what you could have done, I guess, is use the Playwright MCP to be like, "Hey, I think I want to add this tool. I'm not sure where. Go and check other competitor websites to see where they post it." That sort of thing.

Absolutely, you could do that. If you do some research on let's say conversion rate optimization or how are people using lead magnets on their website, you could get a number of suggestions. That comes from experience, like seeing the little opt-in boxes at the bottom or a hello bar or an exit modal popup or a dedicated section in the landing page. You can do any one of those. Yes, you can use AI to research how to integrate it as well. Or if you had some sort of lead magnet or CRO, conversion rate optimization skill, you could invoke that, right? Exactly. Yeah. And to do that, you could say, "Hey, Perplexity, go do deep research on lead magnets and conversion rate optimization or whatnot. Compile all the learnings." And then you can say, "Hey, Claude, create a skill based on this."

All right. So, we're building it now. And then after we build this lead magnet, we're going to get to the traffic generation part. So, you've got a landing page, you got a website, you've got unique positioning, it looks good, it feels good, it sounds good, you've got this mechanism to collect email addresses, and then we're going to figure out how we nurture those leads, and we're going to figure out how to drive traffic into the whole system. And again, complete marketing system. So far, we're at I don't know 54 minutes or something like that. And typically this would take a lot longer or it would cost a lot of money to hire an agency to do all this for you.

And who knows if it would even be good too, right? For sure. And I mean, this lets you add your taste and your perspective on your business into it. You don't have to go and hop on a Zoom call and then wait 3 days and get a deck or something like that that you then have to discuss and go back through. It just cuts out the junk and lets you get to work and ship stuff.

So what's happening right now? So right now we are implementing our lead magnet modal onto the landing page and that should be ready here shortly. And as soon as that's ready, we'll pop it open and we'll have a look. The old compacting conversation. Always fun. Look at those tokens just rack up. I know. It used to be really scary when that would happen. My terminal would start shaking. It looked like an earthquake was happening in there and then sometimes it would shut down and I'd be like, "No." But they've done a lot to improve that I've noticed over the past couple months.

Well, yeah, they're making money. It was smart of them to call it tokens, not dollars and cents. Oh, yeah, for sure. There's still this cognitive gap between, oh wait, tokens are money? But, to be honest, everyone always asks me, how much do you spend on Claude Code? It must be crazy. And I just have a Max subscription. It's $200 a month and I've never run out of tokens. There you go. And you're constantly vibing. Constantly.

I've probably messaged you like three times a day with different stuff I'm making in Slack. Much to the chagrin of your wife. Exactly. Whisper Flow, she probably doesn't appreciate too because you're working from home and you're just constantly talking to Claude. She's like, "Who are you talking to?" And she's just completely outside of tech and AI and stuff. So, she thinks I'm the weirdest person on the planet. And then, we'll be doing stuff around the house and I'll have this running in the background or something, be coming over and checking my laptop and hitting a prompt again or whatever. It's a whole different lifestyle nowadays.

Do you ever use Claude Code on the phone, iOS? I don't. I tried to do it one time. So I used the Claude app and you can access the same sort of tools from Claude desktop in the app and Claude Code there could access existing repositories and things like that. But a lot of the work that I do is oftentimes knowledge work and things like that. So it was nothing that was in an existing repo and I couldn't just keep working. But I've seen people use like CLAWE where they're working with Claude Code in WhatsApp and all kinds of other tools. But I don't know. I feel like I already spend enough time with Claude Code. I don't really need it everywhere I'm chatting.

I recently chatted with Boris, the maker of Claude Code, and he was like, "Yeah, you should basically be using it on your phone, too." Like, if you want, if you're a real Claude Code maxi, you're doing it on your phone too. So, something to think about. I'm thinking about it. I may have to try it.

All right. So, we've got our little audit button down here. I clicked it and here's our audit or our assessment. So, find the leaks costing you jobs, answer 15 questions, get your score instantly. So, this is a really good little lead magnet idea. Do you respond to new leads within 10 minutes? I'll just say no. Do you have any automated response for after hours? No. Can a potential customer book a consultation from your website? Yes. Follow-up system. After sending a quote, do you follow up three times automatically? No. Do you have a system to re-engage leads? No. Do you know your quote to close rate? Sure. Reviews.

I mean, this is pretty comprehensive here. Yeah. Well, not only is it comprehensive, it works. The alternative would have also been setting up a Tally or Typeform, paying them, could be $1,000 a year. Who knows? And this is just done, optimized. The copy is dialed. Like, I'm a copy person. I'm reading this and I'm like, "Yes, yes, yes." So, want us to fix these gaps? We can build the whole system. Landing pages, lead response, follow-up automation, review generation in 5 days. See what we build. Book a call. That's your call link. And then you can download the full report that builds your email list right there. So, good stuff.

So the next question is how do you drive traffic into the funnel? And let's use a couple skills to see how we would approach that. Okay, I like our funnel. Now, it's time to think about how we drive traffic into it. First thing I want you to do is use the keyword research skill to identify a programmatic SEO opportunity targeting local markets. And I also want you to come up with an ad strategy using the DTC ad skill.

So, if you don't know what that stuff means, you can ask Claude Code to help you do some keyword research. And keyword research obviously is people searching for certain terms on Google. You want to show up through good content, high-quality website, etc. So, I'm a partner in a boring local business. We've done videos on that and stuff. When I built that website, I'll be honest with you, I didn't go and look at exact volume and how much people are paying to bid on these keywords and all that. You can easily get lost in the information there. So, I just wanted a place to go from zero to one and a place to start, which is what this particular skill helps me do. You can build your own to figure out how to go from zero to one as well. But this is essentially going to understand what we're doing, what we're building here on Boring Money. And then it's going to give us a full pipeline of content ideas that we can create. And remember, we already have a brand voice, a unique angle, an ICP, a target market, a website. So, we can use a content skill to generate that content and then push it right onto the website here to start ranking in Google search.

So yeah, I mean it's crazy. One place, one view, one terminal. When you and I first started talking about vibe marketing, Greg, this kind of stuff wasn't really possible. And I think what we've been seeing is the evolution in real time. Back in February of 2025, the whole thing we were building in workflows and agents and things that way and there was a lot of friction. Great tool but it was hard to scale those activities up. Then the vibe coding stuff started picking up and then obviously the Claude Code renaissance. And I feel like Claude Code is really what makes vibe marketing 100% a real thing. I've seen people say, "Oh vibe marketing, what's that? It's workflows?" No, you can deploy complete marketing systems and campaigns right from the terminal just how you would vibe code any product. So that's the big unlock, learning tools like this. I see it in the community as well. This is the topic everyone is wanting to learn.

So accessible, right? So accessible. There's a little bit of friction when you get started. The terminal looks a little scary and things like that, but once you get in there and realize this is just like any other LLM, I can ask it for help, it can guide me, you start chipping away bit by bit and getting more and more comfortable.

All right, so we have comprehensive strategies here to get organic and paid traffic. We've got a bunch of ideas for how to build out the website, how to develop content at scale, and also how to create ads that will perform. Quick wins, sort of synthesized where we should get started for organic traffic. Picked out some markets that based on Claude Code's understanding could be underserved and then we have a complete ad strategy as well. So we'll make a couple assets here. Use the SEO content skill to develop a page for a website based on your top quick win opportunity. And use Remotion to create a video ad using our brand style.

And do you need to install Remotion? You do. You need to install it. Again, if you go to X, Remotion posted this video that has a free GitHub repository of how they built the video and has a video there. You can see kind of how they did it. You can get that link to the repo. You can throw it in here and it'll install all the packages for you and you can essentially vibe create videos just how you would anything else. Which is pretty cool.

All right. Let's see here. So, we're setting up a page. And you know what? I'm going to go ahead and throw this command in here for Remotion. I had it in my other window from doing some things earlier. So, when I look at ads, I really like to analyze the direct to consumer ecom market. They're pumping out the most ads, doing the most testing, spending a lot of money. And they're very good at finding hooks, angles, and formats that drive conversion. So, if I'm working on a boring business or I'm working on an educational product or something like that, I always find inspiration from DTC and I try to repurpose that toward the thing that I'm selling.

Cool. And a lot of people don't know this about you, but you've spent well over a hundred million dollars on ads, right? Yeah. Well over a hundred million. And that's kind of how I got my start into growth marketing and all that. Just being behind the scenes running a bunch of campaigns for different companies and things of that nature. So yeah, that's how I got my start. So, guy who spent 100 plus million in ads with large teams, large companies and also fast growing startups is using Claude Code to build his ad campaigns.

All right. So we're going to build that landing page. Yeah, you remember how it was a few years ago, trying to get creatives for your campaigns was such a pain. Designers that you would find, they didn't understand what made good ads work. Finding a conversion focused ad designer was like finding a unicorn. It was always very difficult to find. Creating videos was expensive and painful. I still don't feel like, I mean I know people are scaling up UGC ads that are created with AI. I personally haven't done that yet. I don't know if it's quite there. I could be totally wrong. Maybe I can test it. But I think for things like static images, you can extract the frameworks that companies are running by going through the Facebook ad library or there are a number of tools out there. And then you can use Nano Banana Pro to create a few statics.

I of course have skills that I use to create images right here in Claude Code. I call on Glyph through the MCP to access Nano Banana Pro and I've done a bunch of research into letting Claude Code create optimal image prompts and it does a really good job kind of programmatically creating different variations for me. You could also use Glyph to call video models. So if you wanted to make a video ad or whatever. And then Remotion does a really good job at creating those sort of product demo style ads like we looked at with the one that I created.

Okay, so we created an SEO page. We set up Remotion with that one command. Again, you can set that up easily. It's free. They have a full gist that shows their prompts and stuff like that. That's the one I use to make the one that I demoed for you. We won't go through and completely dial that in, but you can sort of vibe back and forth with it until you get to the output that you like. But a big shortcut: if you just want to go from zero to one and get a campaign live, you can make your landing page, you can get your ad creative, you can do everything right here. You can create 20 different landing page variations, 20 different ads. You could become a testing machine in a sitting.

Can and should. Even if you have an agency or whatever or you want to hire an agency, you should start by doing this because you're going to dial it in yourself. You're going to really understand it yourself by doing this. Exactly. And this is the same thing I'm doing in real time to try to launch. This morning I was making that video ad. I was building the funnel. I was dialing in that lead magnet and I'm going to go launch a funnel hopefully today pending the email sequences that I need to do next. So, this is what I'm doing and hopefully people can just follow along and do it themselves.

All right, so it's making our video right now trying to capture our brand style. And what I noticed here is so far with Remotion you do have to go prompt back and forth a little bit. So I'm not expecting a crazy result from this one shot here. But again more of a demo. You're not expecting a Super Bowl ad. Yeah. Exactly. But you can ping-pong your way to something that could have legs. Yeah, exactly. The one that I showed earlier, I'm going to run that in a campaign. I'm going to use that. I used their GitHub link and went back and forth for about 30 minutes to get that.

So when it's done, it'll open up Remotion in a browser window, which is pretty cool. So it creates the ad and then it'll show you all the variations there. And we'll have a look at that here in a moment when it's ready. We have some things to check out and let's open them up. All right, so we've got sort of a basic animated ad here. Again, we could go back and vibe back and forth to kind of get to the output we want, but for getting going or whatever, being able to create it from the terminal, pretty handy little workflow that you can use.

All right, let's see if it created any others. So, it created a square variation, a vertical video. You can get a landscape one as well. And then we also have our SEO optimized page on the website created too. So again, this used some keyword research processes from Claude Code. I like how it integrated our lead magnet on this page. If somebody searches HVAC in Phoenix or HVAC marketing for Phoenix, this will pop up, got the landing page, etc. There's still work that has to be done to get these pages indexed to make sure it's really good to drive links to the site. I don't want to make it sound like all you have to do is create this stuff and start showing up in Google. That's not the case. But producing high-quality content on the website targeted towards search terms relevant to the business is a step that you should definitely do. And it's worth it to do that work from Claude.

Looks good. Yeah. So, one more view of that video that I made just to show you if you do go back and forth with it and if you do use that GitHub file that the Remotion team provided, you can create something pretty cool, pretty dialed that is pretty solid to run an ad campaign on or at least test videos if you want.

Yeah, 100%. And now that I've seen the first version of that other version, the Boring Money version, I can see how you just made it better and made it better and made it better. Yeah, exactly. And it's the same process as vibe coding. You can take screenshots of it. You can throw it into Claude Code. Because it generates these using code, it kind of writes the files and it'll use the CSS and the fonts that you have available in your project.

Yeah, next step I would create an email sequence. I would deploy all this probably onto Vercel or something like that. Not to get too technical, but I broke down again, I recorded myself doing this for 2 hours and created all the thought processes, the frameworks, how to stack these things together, prompts people can use, how to create some skills that are useful. And we'll give that to the listeners and I hope it helps them action some of this in their company.

100%. Yeah, I'll include that in the show notes in the description for people to go and click that link, get started, get their hands dirty. And thank you for sharing some sauce, showing your workflow. I definitely learned a few things today, so I know other people for sure have as well. And dude, I can't thank you enough. I'm curious what people think in the comment section. And what we should have James back on, the Boring Marketer, next time. So, you're one of my favorite people to have on the podcast. So, thanks again for coming on and see you. Yeah, I appreciate you, Greg. Thanks for having me. Talk to you soon. Later.

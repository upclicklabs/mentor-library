# Ultimate Guide to AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)

## Key Takeaways

- **AEO Is The New SEO**: Chat surfaces like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini now use search to power answers, converging AI chat with search functionality.
- **AEO Topics**: Rather than targeting single questions, landing pages should target hundreds of questions with similar intent grouped as topics.
- **Question Types**: AEO includes head, mid-tail, and long-tail questions with different optimization strategies. Focus specifically on Product Questions that show products in answers.
- **The 5% of AEO**: Most SEO and AEO work produces minimal impact, but a small number of strategies can drive outsized impact.
- **Test and Validate**: Avoid relying on unverified case studies. Test strategies to confirm actual impact before implementation.

## How LLMs Work

### LLMs and Next-Word Prediction

- ChatGPT launched November 2022, gaining significant adoption 1-2 years later
- Original LLMs trained on static web page snapshots from Common Crawl with 1+ year old data
- This feedback loop made optimization difficult or impossible

### LLM + RAG Evolution

- Modern LLMs increasingly use LLM + RAG architecture
- When users ask questions, a search is performed first, then the LLM summarizes the results
- This enables fresh data less than one day old versus previously outdated training data

### AI Chat Is Converging With Search

- Perplexity.ai launched as an LLM search engine from inception
- ChatGPT has recently added clickable blue links, maps, and traditional search elements
- The core principles of search engine optimization (SEO) largely apply to answer engine optimization (AEO)

## AI Is Growing, The Time Is Now

### June 2024 - Initial Interest

- Initial AEO strategies proposed in Reforge Webinar
- Reforge created dedicated SEO and AEO Course

### January 2025 - Rapid Expansion

- Dramatic explosion of AEO interest since January 2025
- Multiple AEO platforms raising venture capital funding
- ChatGPT now displays prominent clickable links and maps
- Referral traffic from ChatGPT dramatically increased over the past three months
- Interest expected to dramatically increase over the next few years

## The 5%

### The 5% Of SEO

The industry secret: most strategies don't work, most landing pages drive little to no traffic, and thus, most SEO efforts are often wasted.

How does SEO still drive significant traffic? A small number of strategies are highly impactful, and a small number of landing pages (typically 5% of pages) drive significant traffic.

### How To Find The 5%

Three-step process for identifying high-impact initiatives:

1. **Generate Ideas** - Research, expert consultation, data analysis, and brainstorming
2. **Test and Evaluate** - Split testing (control vs. test groups) or sequential testing with statistical significance measurement
3. **Reproduce Results** - Validate that results consistently occur across multiple tests before accepting as valid

**Common Problem**: most people don't properly test and evaluate their ideas. People launch things and assume whether and why something worked or didn't, never looking at what actually happened.

### The 5% Of AEO

Best guesses for most impactful AEO strategies:

- **New Pages** - Create landing pages for uncovered AEO topics
- **Content Enhancement** - Add content filling gaps in existing pages for targeted topics
- **Citation Optimization** - Identify cited URLs for priority topics and promote your product through them

### Technical AEO - Biggest Waste of Time

Like Technical SEO, the field will likely see widespread focus on low-impact areas:

- Page speed, crawl analysis, indexation measurement
- Miscellaneous technical errors
- Recommendation: Be aware that Technical AEO will likely create significant work with little to no impact

Exceptions that do matter: internal links and page rendering

### Beware Of Fake AEO Case Studies

Watch for misleading claims:

**Misattribution**: LLM usage is rapidly growing. Traffic increases may result entirely from platform growth, not optimization. Solution: Use control groups with statistically significant comparison testing.

**Relative Versus Absolute**: Citing percentage increases without context (1 to 10 visits = 900% increase) is misleading. Solution: Focus on total traffic representing at least 5% of site traffic.

**Vanity Metrics**: Focusing on keyword rankings or impressions without conversion data. Solution: Prioritize visits and conversions as primary KPIs.

## AEO Topics

### Targeting By Keyword

Historically, SEO teams created individual pages per keyword to match searches exactly, leading to millions of programmatically generated pages.

### AEO Topics and Question Research

An AEO topic clusters many questions with a similar search intent. Single pages can fulfill intent for numerous related questions.

### Search Volume Of Questions

Currently lacking true data sources. No equivalent ad products exist yet for AI platforms. Until then, we have to guess which questions are asked the most.

### The Long Tail of Questions

- **Head questions**: High volume, high difficulty
- **Mid-tail questions**: Medium volume, moderate difficulty
- **Long-tail questions**: Low volume, low competition

### Search Vs. Conversation

Key difference: Search doesn't save state between queries, but AI is built to facilitate conversations where your state is saved. Users ask initial questions then follow-ups, requiring pages to address not just initial inquiries but many follow-up questions.

### Owned Vs. Earned

- **In search**: Most impact comes from ranking your own site
- **In AI**: LLMs summarize multiple search results into single answers
- **General questions**: Publisher sites dominate; earned mentions matter more
- **Specific questions**: Product companies appear more frequently; owned strategy works better

### Product Questions

Not all questions show products. Product Questions explicitly show product recommendations.

**Category Distribution** (products in answers):
- **Highest**: Travel, commerce, local, tech, crypto
- **Lower**: Food and news (less than 50%)

Research indicates: most questions do have products

## Measurement

### Tracking Share Of Answers

AI measurement requires four-dimensional tracking:

**Share Of Answers**: Distribution showing how often your product appears, similar to Share Of Voice in marketing.

**Track By Surface**: Monitor performance across multiple platforms - ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude.

**Track By Question Variations**: An AEO topic includes hundreds or thousands of questions. Track multiple variations.

**Track By Run**: Unlike Google, the same question can yield different answers each time. Check questions multiple times to measure appearance frequency.

### Tracking Citations

- LLM+RAG returns search results, then LLM summarizes them
- More frequent product mentions in citations increase likelihood of suggestion
- Unlike SEO's emphasis on homepage links, AEO values specific URLs in citation sets
- Track whether cited URLs mention your product to identify optimization opportunities

## Recommendations

- **Invest Now**: The channel is growing rapidly with increased referral traffic
- **Identify Topics**: Track most important AEO topics
- **Create New Pages**: Build landing pages for uncovered AEO topics
- **Enhance Content**: Add content addressing gaps in existing pages
- **Optimize Citations**: Find cited URLs for priority topics and increase product mentions
- **Minimize Technical AEO**: Avoid significant time investment; likely produces minimal impact
- **Choose Tools Strategically**: Select least expensive platform meeting your tracking needs
- **Evaluate Thoroughly**: Test and reproduce strategies yourself before accepting claims

# $7000 Per Day: My LinkedIn Content Strategy Revealed

So, what if I told you that I posted almost every single day last year on LinkedIn and every single post averaged about $7,840.84 of new revenue from new customers as a result of posting on LinkedIn. What if I told you that just by posting every single day, over $7,800 came in off the back of each individual post. So, that's over $50,000 a week because I post seven

days a week. Now, I want to share with you today exactly how I'm doing that, right? We discovered something that breaks all the rules. There are experts who tell you not to do what I'm about to tell you, but I've got $50,000 a week worth of revenue that proves that it totally works. And it breaks three key rules of LinkedIn, but it doesn't matter because it absolutely works. I'm going

to share with you this really cool, simple strategy. You can apply it. You can start doing it every single day and it's going to bring you in business every single day. So, if you've got a LinkedIn account and you've got a Score app account, this strategy that we're going to explore today is going to give you lots of warm leads, lots of hot deals, and it's going to grow your

revenues and grow your profits in the year ahead. I call this the everyday CTA. Okay? So, very simply on LinkedIn, every single day, you're going to make a post that's going to have two parts. Part one is going to be the value, where you share something of value. Part two is a call to action where you're literally going to tell people that they need to click a link and do something.

What we're going to do is break it down over the two and it's going to surprise you some of the rules that this breaks, but I have found that it doesn't matter. It works and it's working unbelievably well. So, I hope you apply this before they change things because it's working really, really well right now. So, let's start with part one. Part one is sharing something of value.

So, when it comes to sharing something of value, I've got five things that always get cut through. And we call this the three S's and two Fs. So, we've got three S's and two Fs. And these five things, they always get cut through. So, the first one is something that is scary. So, it could be some trend that is going to wipe out the industry, or it could be

some new technology that could be disruptive, could be a piece of news that really impacts everyone in the industry. So, it's a scary new thing that has just happened. The next one is strange. So, it's something you've never heard before. It's something different. It's something quirky. It's something out of the ordinary. It's a bit different. No

one's saying it the way you're saying it, right? So, it's something strange or something scary. The next one is something sexy. So, this could be a desirable outcome. It could be a desirable result. It could be based upon the prize that people could get. It could be how to make a million dollars or how to grow your business faster than anybody else or how to win a major

award. Right? So, those are what I think of as the sexy outcomes, the sexy results. These are the things that people really want to achieve. This is where you discuss something that is already familiar to people or you discuss somebody that's already familiar to [music] people. So you might say these are the three top secrets from Warren Buffett about how to grow your

investment portfolio. Right? We're talking about someone who is familiar to us both. So familiar faces, familiar people, you're going to discuss something that is already familiar to people. And then the next one is free value. So free value is something that seems like you would ordinarily have to pay for it, but today it's being given away for free, right? So, it's some free

value, free offer, free piece of value that seems like it's too good to be true because it's packaged up so nicely and it's free. So, it could be based on research that we've just done. You could say, "We just spent $7,000 conducting market research and I want to give that to you for free." Right? So, that's free value. And the key to making free value seem like free value is that it seems

like something that someone has already spent money on or that I should have to spend money on in order to learn that thing. So, scary, sexy, strange, familiar, and free value. These are the five things that get cut through. So you want to do a post here. Now what could that post be? It could be 100 to 500 words. It could be images or carousels.

Could be diagrams. Uh it could be data. So especially visualized data where you actually show people like those doughut charts or the different world map with the percentages colored in. Or one of my favorites is video. I don't know if you know this, but LinkedIn in particular loves video. So, you can put short video on LinkedIn that's less than a minute. But actually, here's what we've

discovered. You can post videos up to 15 minutes long on uh LinkedIn. And we've discovered that we get more views on LinkedIn more often than what we get on YouTube. So, you'd be blown away that sometimes LinkedIn outperforms our YouTube channel for the amount of views that it gets. And I think that's because people at work don't want to get caught watching YouTube videos, but they don't

mind being seen uh engaging on LinkedIn perhaps. Now, the key thing with LinkedIn is that it's really changed from a platform a few years ago that used to be all about people sharing their CVs and looking for jobs to people now doing online business networking. So, the nature of the platform has really evolved and people just kind of see all of this as part of learning and

sharing and connecting and growing together in a business context. In a world that's highly politicized, LinkedIn has also become the place where everyone's got their manners. Uh, everyone is uh getting along, everyone's not arguing. A lot of the times the political topics and the really kind of um divisive topics don't get discussed on LinkedIn. So, it tends to be a place

that people are there to show up to connect and do business. So, it's a great place to be posting every single day. So, this is part one. This is the value proposition. This is where you're sharing something of value every single day. It takes a little bit of thought to plan this out. You can create something called a content calendar where for the next 20 days you've always got a rolling

schedule of what you want to post. You could use Claude or Chat GPT to help you with that. Um, you really only need to set aside a half a day to get inspired and start mapping out the next 20 days worth of content and then just keep adding to it so that you've always got a reservoir that you've got buckets of content that you can just go to and just post every single day. And then as soon

as something happens in your industry that's newsworthy, then that takes precedent. You put that in that section there which is all about the value. Now the second section is called the call [music] to action. Now here's where we break one of the rules. Most experts say that what you have to do is you have to link the value to the call to action. So let's say you're going to ask people to

take an assessment. You're going to say uh take this fitness assessment. Well, what they'll say is that this value content has to be all about fitness and it has to discuss all the problems that uh this fitness assessment is going to solve. Um, and then you have to discuss all the outcomes that you will get if you take the fitness assessment. And that the value and the value of this

post has to link to the call to action. That these two things have to be very aligned. And here's the fun thing. We've discovered that that's not even true. So, you can be talking about absolutely anything that's going on and then say, "By the way, in fact, what we do is have these two little dots. You can see it on my LinkedIn post. We say, "By the way, I'm running a workshop. If you'd be

interested in coming to a workshop for entrepreneurs, here's the link to do so. By the way, I've got a weight list running for a new product that we're launching. If you want to join the wait list, then join the wait list. Uh, by the way, we've got an online assessment to see if you're a key person of influence in your industry. If you want to know how to build yourself a personal

brand in your industry, uh, click the link and take the assessment. So, this is just like, by the way, change of topic, separate thing, gear change moment. Here's something that we're doing that's completely different. And here's what you can do. So with your call to action, I recommend an assessment, a weight list,

a webinar, or a miniourse. So those are four things where you can just say go and do these one of these four things. And if you want, you could have two or three of these things set up and you could just rotate through them. You could change every week or every other day and you can just simply just promote the different calls to action.

The most important thing here is that you do not have to be under any pressure whatsoever to make this valuable content link in any way to the call to action. It's kind of like you're having a conversation with a friend and you're talking about a particular topic and you literally say, "Oh, by the way, change of topic. I'm doing this event. If you want to come along to the event, I'd

love to send you an invitation or I'd love to have you at the event." It's like, "By the way, change of topic, gear change moment. Check this out. Now, as soon as I discovered that this works, it took the pressure off. It was unbelievable because I was really struggling to come up with new content that would link into the call to action. I had what was called CTAA, which is

call to action anxiety. I didn't know how to thread the needle with this content into the call to action. And then we discovered we don't even need to thread that needle. We can just simply do two separate things in one post. Now, here's the next thing that breaks a rule that most experts agree on, but isn't true. We discovered that you do not have to do anything weird with the link to

your CTA, right? You can actually just put the link straight into the post at the bottom of the post here. I was told by multiple experts that you must never put a link into your post, right? That you have to put the link into the comment section or you have to like put spaces between the link and people have to cut and paste it and do weird things with it. This isn't true. We've actually

been doing posts that don't have links and do have links and don't have links and do have links and they get the same number of views. They get the same number of engagement. They get the same number of shares. LinkedIn is not penalizing, as far as I can tell, these links being in posts. So, you do something of value and then you have a call to action with the link right there

in the post. Now, there's something strange that for the last 12 to 24 months, I've been doing this almost every single day, 7 days a week, and no one has ever said something to me like, "You're promoting too much. You're always bombarding us. I wish you would stop banging on about all these things that you're doing. I've never had that comment. I've never had people reach

out. I've never had any of my friends say, "Hey, just quietly. I think you're overdoing it." Weirdly, I do this every single day. And everyone's happy with it. So, provided I provide value and then I say, "Oh, by the way, we've got this other thing that you can do if you want to do this thing." For some reason, that's totally fine. No one cares. No one's no one's saying that I'm a

shameless self-promoter or maybe they're just used to it by now. But for whatever reason, I've had no blowback. There's no disadvantage. Everyone's completely happy because I'm sharing something of value every day. And then I've got a call to action if people want to or not. Now, I always share the call to action with what we call with or without your energy. With or without your energy is

it's happening with or without you. You can do it or not. Doesn't matter. It's available. If you want to click the link, you can do it. If not, that's totally fine as well. Now, the strange thing was is that when I was trying to link the value to the call to action, it did seem needy. It did seem that I was really trying to get people to click the link. It had a different energy to it.

It was like, "Oh, here's all these reasons and by the way that you need to click the link down here." And it felt like the whole purpose of sharing the value was to just get people to click the link. And that wasn't working. So, by having value that is completely unrelated to the call to action, it's working a treat. It's been working for close to 2 years. You can go through my

LinkedIn. In fact, I encourage you go through my LinkedIn. I'll put a link somewhere around here to my LinkedIn and go through and have a look at all my content. Go and look at all the posts and you'll see example after example after example going back years. Piece of value with a call to action. Now, here's what I want you to do. I want you to adopt this policy of everyday CTA.

Everyday CTA is that you're going to post every single day. You're going to share something of value and then completely unrelated, you'll have a call to action to one of your score app landing pages. Now, as I said, this is generating serious money. Uh $75,000 a day worth of new business that we can track just to this strategy. this would be crazy for you not to do this. I

remember the time where you used to have to pay lots and lots of money for ads. You didn't get free organic reach. You couldn't just show up on social media. You couldn't hand select who you wanted to talk to. You couldn't start a conversation. You just had to put ads in the paper. I'm so thrilled that these strategies are working because it is so powerful to be able to show up every

single day and win really great customers who love engaging with the content every single day. Now, I know some people they're a bit skeptical, a bit cynical, and they say, "Oh, well, it's okay for you, Daniel Priestley, because you've already got a big personal brand, but I don't have that personal brand." Well, I can tell you sometimes this absolutely shocks me. The

other day I had a post that only got 40 likes, which is low for me, but it got 200 clicks of the link. I can't explain how that happens, but I can say that sometimes people are lurking on LinkedIn. They're not liking or engaging, but they're clicking the link because it doesn't show up and it doesn't notify their friends. Uh so sometimes below the radar you get a

really good post, you get good at this and you will just see a flood of leads coming [music] in. Right? It's amazing what can happen on LinkedIn even if it doesn't show up above the line. The more you do this, the more you will build a big brand. Uh and this will become another flywheel that you've got going on in your business. Now, of course, it goes without saying that you've got to

have a good landing page. When people go across to your score app, it's got to be optimized. And you've heard me talk about this in the past. A good landing page has a hook. It has a value proposition. It has credibility. And it has a clear call to action on that landing page as well. So that it flows nicely and seamlessly from LinkedIn over to a really beautifully designed landing

page that gives people exactly what they need to know in order for them to engage and opt in on that particular offer. That's the special offer. Really, essentially, what we're trying to do here is give people something that they can connect with. You want to give them an offer that they can freely engage [music] with every single day and link it to content and conversation, right?

But it's easier than you think and I know that you're going to get great results if you apply this. So get yourself your LinkedIn account, get it on fire, link it up to your uh score app account every single day and watch the magic unfold for [music] your business. Now, I hope you enjoyed that. Leave me a comment, leave me a question, give this channel a like and a subscribe. I hope

your business is doing really, really well and I look forward to seeing you on LinkedIn doing the everyday CTA strategy.

# Built a $2.3M LinkedIn Plan in 23 Minutes for a Beginner

This is Cameron. He quit his six-f figureure tech job to build software while traveling the world making more money than any business [music] could ever pay him. But what will take Cameron from where he is right now to scaling faster is content. And this is how his software will get the distribution he needs for free while building authority and getting leads. So today he's going

to sit down with me and we're going to be going through every single one of those steps. And my name is Lara Costa. I built three, [music] six, and seven figure businesses using content and LinkedIn. I built my personal brand from zero to 300,000 followers and I know exactly what [music] the bottlenecks income strategy are and how to fix them today. The key elements we need to cover

in order to build a profitable brand are one expertise and how we can own it. Number two, relevant stories and [music] how we can use them to drive attention. And number three, traffic generation and how to manufacture [music] it. My plan is simple. Ask some questions, get keywords, and build a strategy and a full content system for him to use for the future and for his business. Okay.

So, today we have Cameron here. He is starting building his personal brand on LinkedIn and he has a few problems that we're going to be addressing today. So, Cameron, do you want to introduce yourself? >> Hello, I'm Cameron and I'm a software engineer turn entrepreneur. I have two SAS businesses. I started coding at 13 and yeah, now I build SAS and businesses

for a living. I am currently looking at starting my LinkedIn journey. I'm having a few issues figuring out what to write about, how to go about it, and Lara is the best person at doing this. >> Yes. So, what do you think is your main problem when trying to sit down and write content? >> Without a doubt, it's figuring out what to write about.

>> Yeah. And is it because you don't know what angles work best on the platform or you just can't even figure out what to write? >> I think I have a lot of information to share, but it's figuring out how I can say it in a way that's interesting to other people. >> Amazing. So, with your LinkedIn strategy, cuz you've been coding and you

have all of this knowledge, what is the problem that's stopping you from creating content consistently and well on LinkedIn? >> Right. So I would say Cleo is great for writing the content, but I think what I personally struggle right now is what do I write about? What angle do I write about and how do I go around it? >> And if you were to know like so I want

my personal brand to be this like what do you want to be known for? Cuz we start with what you want to be known for and then your positioning and then the social proof that goes with it. So what do you want to be known for first? I want to be known as the tech guy. The guy who can come into a company and build a tech team and just really like pioneer the technical side of a

business. >> Okay. So within that, what are the main skills that you think you need to talk about or show to educate your ideal client or user or follower about so they trust you as that person as a tech guy? What does a tech guy talk about? So, I think I need to talk about technical things obviously, but this is where I struggle because I personally as a tech

guy, I want to get in the details. I want to nerd out on everybody, but I know that not everybody's interested in the real details. >> Yeah. So, what if we took away all that over complication like you have you want to say everything, what would you actually be talking about right now? >> I would like to talk about the code. >> I would like to talk about things like

tech stack. >> Yep. >> New latest AI tools. Yep. >> How we can use them in Cleo. Yeah. >> So when it comes to coding, like how do you make this beginner friendly? If you were for your ideal clients, they don't know code. So what do they usually come to you to talk about? Like what questions?

>> So I think maybe an angle could be more like the vibe coding side. So me showing somebody without the experience how to build different app, build different tools and start to sell a product. And then for tech stacks is the same. So like they just want to know how to become more productive, how to do that. >> Yes. Like what tools can they leverage to get things done faster?

>> Okay. And then the latest AI tools or trends. Why is that important to you? >> Well, obviously Cleo is an AI based app, but I think in general it's a hot topic. People want to use the latest AI tools. If they know certain things are available, it actually every time there's an advancement in AI, it opens up a whole new world of opportunity for businesses. Okay, that's good. We sorted

that out. So, we have enough knowledge here so we can build a content strategy. Now, for positioning, what type of personal brand do you want to build? There's two types of brands that do incredibly well on LinkedIn. There's the storytelling ones like myself, and then there's education only like Jake's. What do you want to lean more into? Do you want to be known for you or for your

skill? I think I would probably lean towards the story side, but I would also obviously like to show my knowledge >> and social proof is the most important. So, here's how you sort of like differentiate yourself from every other tech guy on LinkedIn. So, you've obviously built Cleo and scale that to >> 62k. >> Nice. And then before that, what else?

And who else have you helped do something of that caliber or something that people would want to listen to you for? also built mentions or passive mentions which is at 20K MR. >> And what does mentions do? >> Mentions is a tool which lets businesses and websites see how they are cited in LLMs. >> These two are B2B SAS companies, right?

Okay. B2B SAS and then anything else? >> I think really before that my authority just comes from the companies I've worked at um mainly just in a 9 toive job at large corporate American companies. >> Okay. Can you say anything about these companies like four to 500? >> Yeah, some of they're worth like several

billion dollars. >> Billion dollar. So the reason why this is important is that if we can just map all of this out, people need to know you for one thing and then they need to trust you based on that because if there's no this, they can't really tell if you're being serious about all of this. That's where we're going to start building your content strategy. So we

need to go for high value skills and then monetizable expertise. So a high value skill is what you can tell stories about and what can what you can educate on. People get this wrong all the time where they feel like they can only educate but never storytell. You can always do both at the same time. Your high value skill is obviously being in tech having built businesses from that.

So tell me two stories that we can use today about you being the tech guy. I built Cleo to 60k. That's one of them. Building like building in public in public. And the next one that would stand out to me would be you quitting your job on a whim to go and work with the Cleo guys, right? >> Yeah. Quitting 9 to5. And then education when it comes to high value is how do we

get a stranger to trust me in less than 60 seconds? You knowing what you know about the market. What do you think would interest someone like me or Rob or Jake to work with you? Well, the thing I see the most is the whole vibe coder project in order weekend. So, if I can show people what's possible within one or two days, maybe they can see well what's possible with someone with

expertise over a longer period of time. >> Okay. Anything else? >> Maybe AI tools which are out there that they can use like your average person can use that will help them. So people will see this and I see this all the time where you'll highlight, oh you can talk about this, you can talk about this, you can talk about this, but people will be like, okay, but where's

the money or how do I grow? All of these, if you think about them, they all lead to a first principle which is financial. Building in public, you showing how you built in public leads to people knowing how they can make more money. You quitting your 9 to5, you quit your 9 to5 for a reason to make more money. So every single thing that we ever talk about always comes back to the

main principle which is making your ideal reader the main character. And so within the first one or two lines of a post, there always needs to be some financial incentive or some sort of hint that this is going to make the user money. That's what we call unselfish content and how we make it all about them. even when you're talking about yourself. And then the monetizable

skills are, you know, how to build a SAS, how to buy code in two hours or less, whatever. Anything else? >> How to use X AI tool. >> And then we always say either to save time, make money, or live a better life. Cool. All right. So before we get into actually writing content with Cleo and AI, we need to understand what your content themes are going to be. This is

what the part when voice people kind of like get confused or where they stop posting content because they use AI and then they'll be like write me a post for this but then there's no continuity like I don't know where this is leading ideally let's say how many posts a week do you think you want to write four >> four or five >> okay so we're going to be following my 4

3 2 1 framework which aligns well with you. So four post a week. And so since you want to build a path of run that's based on your story but also storytelling. The split between the four is going to be one post about education, one post storytelling, one post doing both. So edu telling using the slay framework and then another pose is educating. This immediately removes

every single constraint of like what do I write about? You go into a post knowing that this is going to be an educational post based on what we talked about earlier. So then you don't have to have to decide on the day. You already know what you're writing. Then the three is for the three content themes or content pillars that we're going to be using. So we already decided that you

want to do education and storytelling. So those are not the content pillars. What we're doing is either talking about total addressable market content. So something that goes viral because that's how you're going to increase your followers. That's how you're going to go viral. Then we're going to do growth content. um which is similar to total addressable market content but this is

going to grow you as a person. So people getting invested into your brand rather than just what you're educating on and then this is like sales content. So for total addressable market content is where we talk about something that you have the unfair advantage to talk about that not that many people do which is LinkedIn has these eight keywords that it loves pushing. One of them is AI. The

other one is productivity. The other one is remote work. Um the other one is LinkedIn itself. LinkedIn loves it when you talk about LinkedIn. So you already have four. And so when you think about this, you already have the cheat codes to create content that actually performs well without really doing that much extra work because someone else that doesn't work remotely, that doesn't know

how to use AI, will have to kind of figure out how to link everything back to but you don't because you automatically already talk about these things. Then growth content is going to be stories that again are linked to fast principles. Your 9 to5, quitting your job, building a SAS, talking about money, these things. And then sales content goes back to how we're actually

monetizing you. Will you be promoting Cleo in your content? >> Yes. >> Yeah. And then will you be selling your consultancy or anything else or just Cleo only? >> At this stage, I just want authority. >> Okay. So, we only want to drive traffic to your main SAS or your two SAS. And then the thing here is the two. So

there's two types of personas that you want to talk to every single time. Most marketers always focus on one and that is your ideal client persona. Right? Everybody talks about this. There's another one. It's called the IFP, ideal follower persona. The people that are 18, 19, 20 that can't afford our product, but they can afford to support you. These are the people that we want

to get the most because they're going to push this type of content to your ideal client. Okay. Now the last thing is my favorite one. What do you think this is? One thing a week that I love so much. One lead magnet >> magnet a week. So at first like one of my core principles as people know is lead magnets. Why do you think we need lead magnets every single week for a

personal brand? >> To capture their emails. >> Yes. The thing with lead magnets on LinkedIn is that they serve in two different ways. So when you post a lead magnet, you get emails. But the second thing is that these are some of the most viral formats on LinkedIn because you automatically get more virality because people always want free stuff. So if

you're consistently pushing lead magnets, people get to follow you, they find you, they know you, and they trust you, which is like literally what we're trying to do with all of these these things. But this is all in one. But most people don't poison them because they don't know how. But you know how because we built some magnets together. Okay, cool. Now we are you clear on this?

>> I'm clear on this. So let's revisit. So the four posts. So if you were to educate on something today, what would it be? >> By coding. >> Okay. B coding. And then so if I said how to b code assass in 2 minutes. That does that make sense? >> Something like that. >> Cool. Storytelling. Your next

storytelling post would be about >> quitting my job. >> Okay. And then how do we make it interesting to someone else? >> We >> use Cleo. >> Use clear. >> And we link it back to a problem that they have. So I quit my 9 to5 to go fly to Canada. Here's exactly how you can do

it as well. That's the second thing. But clear can also help us do that. And then storytelling using the slay. So if you were to tell a story about something like B coding, the way that we would do it is like I started by coding when I was 15. Since then, I built two B2B SES that are nearly six years each. And then here's how. So that's how we retain that

authenticity but still educate an audience that is in your IFB and then your ICP. Okay. And then again, we educate back and then you can create a how-to step by step how to build a SAS product. Cool. >> Yeah. >> All right. So, we're going to hop on to Cleo. This is my Cleo. So, it doesn't have your information, but ideally what

we would have done is that we will put everything that we just went through from the content that you're going to talk about educating and storytelling in some context about you and how we just put it in your knowledge base. Then, we're going to write like me because this is my writing style on Cleo. And so how are we going to write your first post? The prompt is I want to write five

ideas for my next LinkedIn post. I want to be known as the tech guy in my industry. I want to talk about Vive coding, etc. Give me hug ideas that match fast principles. Add urgency scars to your firmware if needed. And then make this total addressable market content. On top of this, I'm going to add a secret cleo swipe file that we created that has all the knowledge in

here. You can also find it within the writing frameworks, right? the >> viral SOP. >> The viral SOP is somewhere here. So once we have that, it should give us five amazing hook ideas that can make you go viral tomorrow, huh? Yeah. So the first one, I built two six figure SAS products using Vive coding. You don't need clean code to hit six figures. Vive coding is

dead in 6 months. I left my corporate job to build worse software. Wow, >> it's an angle. >> Most engineers will never build a profitable product. I think this is good. Okay. So then we actually prompted to write it. Ideas are good because they teach you exactly how you need to take your idea and actually make it a topic that people are interested in rather

than just a topic that you're interested in. And obviously then Cleo is going to write it here. So most engineers will never build a profitable product. I was one of them for years. Oh, this is great. What Cleo is doing here, we are doing to a few things. So most engineers, so we're categorizing one of your ideal audiences that will follow you and then they they want to know how

to build a profitable product. So immediately we're giving them the payoff. And then the second thing is you're then relating back to you. So this is entertaining while they're educating and this defeats the typical viral LinkedIn slop which is like here's how to build a productivity app. It's about them through the lens of you because everybody wants to build a

profitable product in seconds and then you know you write the entire post based on whatever Cleo gives you. Any question? >> No. That's good. If you were to leave now, what do you think would stop you from being more consistent or feeling like you're on track? >> I think would be probably like validation of my ideas. So, I think what

I would probably do is I'd probably split out each of the different pillars. I'd probably come up with ideas for each of the pillars. But then until I guess I've I've done the practice and I I've seen what works and what doesn't, my first question would be, is this a good idea? >> Okay. So, how I would validate the idea is using Cleo's swipe file because how

we we've built it is we can tell what people are saving right now. And so, if you take a validated idea that someone else has saved, then you put it next to your post that you wrote, you can sort of like see what type of content is doing well on the platform. And that's exactly how I built my content. It's like by understanding patterns, not just regurgitating what other people are

saying. Like, is this formatting working right now? is this topic and angle like negative, positive. Oh, this person used a lot of images. Maybe I should do that for myself. And it's about testing and iterating until it works. The topics that you want to write about are always going to perform well, but you just need to find out the right way to promote them. Does that make sense? Usually, a

fast track is always telling stories and always using a photo. Let's go back to let's say me on my LinkedIn strategy. What I realized is that I was playing LinkedIn on hard mode because I was trying to be really cool and not really use any photos because I was like, I'm too good for that. But then I realized like LinkedIn is a social media platform where you need to retain attention. A

fast way to retain attention fast is by adding a graphic because what people don't kind of see is that when you put a graphic on your post, it takes over the entire feed. And so that gives you more time to win someone over and get them to actually read your posts rather than just doing texton content. So another hack and hence why we're here in London is to get as many photos as possible so

we can almost position you as a tech guy doing tech guy things and also talking about tech, right? Because people right now need this extra validation that you're not just doing the thing, but you also are that thing. There's too many LinkedIn personal branding experts right now talking about personal branding with 10,000 followers or thousand followers. But now, how do we get someone that has

a thousand followers but also is worth a 100,000 followers to look the part by using the right content in the right cues? Yeah. >> Yeah. So, do you ever go through and find a viral post and even though it's not necessarily in your niche? >> Yeah. >> Do you then just copy say the formatting or try and then relate it to one of your

four pillars? >> Oh, 100%. So there's someone that I really admire in the industry and his name is Jake Ward. What Jake did that broke LinkedIn two years ago and I personally say this because I saw it he wouldn't say it because he won't admit it. Jake became the best technical writer on LinkedIn which allowed many people like myself understand how to

write technically. He [snorts] writes about SEO. I write about marketing but then I realized that he was breaking down such complex topics in such depth and so I copied it. So let's say this one, the new SEO game if SEO search is a real optimization. I don't know how to do SEO in 2026. So I'll see this and there's two things I can think. This doesn't have anything to do with me, so

I can't copy it. Or I can be like, this worked well. Let me reverse engineer why. And so I'll take this and I'll be like, okay, how can I break down LinkedIn marketing or personal branding in 2026 and do it exactly how he's doing it? So what levels can I actually break down? They don't need to be six like he has here, seven. It can be three. But if we just do it in micro steps like he's

broken it down, then I know I can potentially get a similar result. So you can do that as well. Whenever I don't have any information about any client, I just go and look till the ends of the ad for any blogs, any content, any YouTube stuff that I can take and then immediately just use context. So context is Jake's post because it's giving us the the winning format. And then proof

that you've done something similar from YouTube, blogs, you can either even use your SOPs, whatever. Then we're going to add it here. So, write me a post on my strategy to scale B2B SAS Zaga. Would you say good? >> Here's some info. So, this removes all the friction between finding the idea, finding what you want to write about, finding the best hook to talk about, and

then it's just the final draft is done for you in 2 seconds or less. It's 80% done. Obviously, you need to go back and shift things, but that's exactly how I've been doing it manually this entire time, and that's how Jake did it manually this entire time. But now, you can do it in 2 seconds. Now the last thing that I want to add before we wrap up is that the images play a really big

part on this. So whenever people use AI and even if it's charged etc. Where people fail in the execution is that they'll try and copy a viral post but they won't copy it correctly. They won't emulate it. You need to emulate from the structure the hook the formatting uh even the CTA but also the image that you're using. So obviously you and I can't make this right now right? But

what can we do in less than an hour today or like whatever time allocation we have to write a post. We can go on Canva. We can try and make something similar. We can add a photo of us working. So we can just add that. And then maybe your SEO strategy is on the screen. So we always want to give context. One person that does this very well is Richard Moore. He has this

strategy where he doesn't really use infographics, but he always use candid photos of himself which positions him as an authority always because he's always speaking. He's always in a suit. So he's sort of like telling people who he is without that. So for you it would be like you looking like a B2B SAS nerd and in your laptop because that's exactly what your ideal client and someone

looking for you wants to see. You being yourself. That's pretty much it. We walk through actually understand how to build your positioning, what strategy is better for you, how to build it, the type of post that you need to write and then actually writing the final post in seconds. Do you have any questions? How do I remain authentic and make sure that it always sound like me?

>> So when we built your content pillars at the start and even your strategy, we focused a lot on your story and what you specifically educate on and your social proof, right? That is the main thing that will keep you authentic and what is going to pull people to you. So when we're using AI, when we're emulating other people's content, when we're using people's swipe files, your content won't

always sound like them as long as you prompt it, right? So even the outputs that we had for AI content earlier, they sound like you because we gave a context about you. And that's how we kind of like beat that from being just generic AI fluff that Chad GPT writes. This is what makes tools like Cleo so different. And also the tool is basically built on you. So when you are on boarded onto the

platform, you already know this, but for people watching this, we know the about you, your story, etc. Which means that every single time we create content, it will always be backed on your story in your beliefs rather than just copy and pasting the viral format. What we've trained Cleo to do is follow formats, but not the content, just the context ideally. So that's how you stay

authentic and not a typical viral fluff person on LinkedIn. Cool. Let's go. Come first as viral post tomorrow. High five.

# Learn what's new in Sonnet 4.5

Note: This page redirected to platform.claude.com and returned a models overview page rather than specific Sonnet 4.5 release notes. The content below reflects the models documentation available at the redirected URL.

## Models Overview

Claude is a family of state-of-the-art large language models developed by Anthropic. All current Claude models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, and vision.

## Choosing a Model

For the most complex tasks, consider starting with **Claude Opus 4.6**, the latest generation model with exceptional performance in coding and reasoning.

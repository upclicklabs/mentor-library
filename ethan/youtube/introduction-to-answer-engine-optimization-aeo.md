# Introduction to Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

When someone asks AI a question,   like “What’s the best productivity tool for 
me?” or “Which design platform has the best   collaboration tools?” They’re not getting 
a list of links to your content anymore. They’re getting a rewritten 
version of your brand story. And that version may not be 
the answer you want given. Even if your team has spent years working 
to rank in search and carefully shaping   your brand message, AI might describe you in a 
way that’s generic or misrepresents your brand. Or worse, confidently get it 
wrong. Or not mention you at all! That’s the challenge marketing teams are facing 
right now: AI engines are rewriting the rules   of search and recasting your brand narrative 
and deciding how much traffic you receive.

And that is where AEO comes in. AEO — 
or Answer Engine Optimization — is about   appearing in AI search results by optimizing 
your content, tech, and earned presence so   that your content is easily discoverable and 
understandable by the LLMs that power AI search. Unlike traditional search engines that 
return your own words in a list of links,   answer engines — like ChatGPT, Google’s AI 
overviews, Gemini, and Copilot — they’re   designed to give users the answer directly, 
often without ever leaving the AI search. Instead of typing keywords and 
clicking through multiple sites,   people are asking fuller questions and expecting 
a single, clear, trustworthy answer, right away. And that’s the shift. AEO is about preparing your content so that 
when someone asks a question you care about,  

you appear in the answer in a positive light. Now, you might be wondering: what's 
the difference between SEO and AEO?   They're both about helping 
people find your business. But AEO is actually pretty close to what good 
SEO always should have been where original   content that genuinely helps prospects 
move through the funnel is rewarded. And happily, some of the games that work 
in SEO today, they’re just less effective   in AEO. AEO also removes the whole concept 
of keyword ranking — because the results   are paragraphs — and increases the 
importance of answering questions,   adding structure to help LLMs understand your 
content, and repeated positive mentions of   your brand on other sites that are 
in plain text - links not needed.

AEO is an evolution of SEO, not a revolution. Your SEO team is your AEO team. Your SEO agency is your AEO agency. Don’t stop your SEO work, 
such as cultivating backlinks. Do refocus your energy on the 
content, technical, authority,   and measurement work that will help you appear 
more often and more accurately in LLM answers. Why does this matter? Because the way 
people search is changing. And it’s   changing because AI search is genuinely valuable. ChatGPT reached 100 million users in two 
months, faster than any other product ever.   95% of B2B marketers say that they are going 
to use generative AI in their buying process.

Instead of “speaking Google” like we all learned 
how to do, with queries that average four words,   people are now using conversational queries 
that average 23 words long. And answer engines   are built to respond conversationally, 
often triggering a healthy back and forth. And therefore the LLMs have more 
signal about what content is useful. AI search is both threat and opportunity 
to the two parts of marketing’s job:   building brands and driving revenue. And it’s early days. Not 
everyone is doing this yet. And that means you can show up more often 
in LLMs today by going to your website and   taking action now - compared to 
those that wait to take action. To leave you with one example about how 
early days it is: schema metadata is a  

technical tool to help both search engines and 
LLMs understand the structure of your content. 73% of Google’s top answers 
use schema, but, astonishingly,   88% of sites don’t have schema on 
them. There is real opportunity here! So, as you’re building, we invite you 
to focus in four areas to take back   brand narrative control and drive more traffic: 
content, technical, authority, and measurement. That is the future of search, and 
AEO is how you prepare for it.

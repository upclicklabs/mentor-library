# How Webflow 2x'd Sign-ups From LLMs

## The Challenge

Webflow and Graphite partnered to expand beyond traditional SEO into AEO (Answer Engine Optimization). Between January and July 2025, Graphite clients saw LLM traffic increases of 100-300%, while Webflow received 4% of signups from LLMs. The teams aimed to build an AEO roadmap to identify scalable strategies for AI search.

## The Solution

The strategy focused on two citation sources: onsite content (Webflow's website) and offsite content (Reddit, YouTube, influencer channels). Analysis revealed Reddit appeared in 10% of ChatGPT citations and YouTube in 5% of ChatGPT and 32% of Perplexity responses.

**Content types targeted:**
- Template pages (highest converting)
- Blog pages
- Affiliate publications
- YouTube and Reddit channels

## Key Results

- **94% share of voice growth** from LLMs (33% to 64%)
- **2x signup increase** from LLMs (4% to 8%)
- **24% signup conversion rate** (versus 4% for non-brand SEO)

## Strategies That Drove Results

### Long Tail Questions
Teams published blog content answering specific, long-tail queries structured by team type and tool integration, achieving 100% share of voice for targeted questions.

### Template Page Optimization
Added above-the-fold copy including head questions, branded terms, target users, and pain points to 1.5k template pages, increasing Q1-Q2 LLM signups from 168 to 983 (485% QoQ growth).

### Reddit Strategy
Implemented transparent, value-focused engagement on relevant threads, resulting in 98% positive/neutral responses and 135% YoY views growth in r/Webflow.

### Table of Contents
Structured blog posts with detailed TOC sections, achieving 23% click growth and 60% AI visit growth over four weeks.

### Headers as Questions
Reformatted blog headers as user questions to aid AI matching, generating 58% uplift in AI visits after control adjustment.

## Testing Methodology

Teams used T-test methodology with paired test/control groups across five weeks, achieving p-values of 0.001-0.002 for statistical significance.

## Key Takeaway

LLMs can drive brand visibility and increase conversions. AI chat users demonstrate higher intent (6x conversion of SEO) due to conversational behavior.

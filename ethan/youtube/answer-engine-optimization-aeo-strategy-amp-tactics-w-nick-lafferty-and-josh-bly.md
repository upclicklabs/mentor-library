# Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Strategy &amp; Tactics w/ Nick Lafferty and Josh Blyskal (Profound)

Was [Music] [Music] that the questionnaire I filled out? Was that like helpful for you? Oh, >> it was very like PR. >> You guys just said like uh I want to talk about AI AEO and I was like yeah >> I I kind of expected that like five like five minutes on that maximum.

>> Yeah. So when when we said AEO like was there anything specific we wanted to talk about. I have so many questions and I can frame them to get you guys into debates and stuff. It depends on what you want to know for sure. Definitely. I mean there we could talk macro, we could talk micro, we could talk about like what what is AEO? Like what is the concept of what we're

doing here? Like >> what is AEO? >> I mean AEO is the it's the answer to the question like how do you market to people who are using answer engines? How do you actually get your products, brands, services to show up in uh tools and platforms like chatbt, perplexity, Google AI overviews, Google AI mode? So it is the practice and art and science

of doing that and doing it repeatably. Is there a difference between AEO and GEO and AISO and LLM O and >> besides the heading? >> I heard another one too. It was like AIO or something. I don't even know what it was. >> As far as I see it, AEO is the best term because consumers are moving from search being the means to the end to the end

itself. Like consumers, they don't want search results, they want answers. >> And so the engines that provide those answers are answer engines. And we're optimizing to make brands, products, services the answers to people's questions. Mhm. >> People are calling it generative engine optimization. I think it's like totally fine, whatever, three stars out of five.

I think when you say things like that though, it's like it's really not the generative part that we're really thinking about. We're really thinking about hyperobsessing over answers for customers. Um, and it embodies kind of the modality shift of like user behavior, right? People want answers. They want to understand what is recommended and what's the best thing in

the world, right? What's the best car? What's the best CRM? >> What's the answer? Chad GBT will give you that. >> I think that makes sense. Like logically speaking, it's just too vowy. >> Answer engine optimization. There's you need like a hard content to like kind of close it out. >> But if you search GEO, you just get

>> geography, right? Gio just changed their category name from GEO to AEO. >> Oh, really? Yeah. >> I plan to flag in both arenas. I I want to win whatever. So I I just say what the CMO says. I'm like whoever whoever's the budget that's what I say. So we've got listicles for both. >> Um is AI search going to kill

traditional search? >> I don't think AI search is going to like kill traditional search. And if and if like those things come into like direct conflict with each other, I think it's going to be more like they coales into one unified experience more than like there is no room for SEO. Like my perspective is that in 5 to 10 years basically the way that Google AI mode

operates where you have to like click into those AI generated answers >> you're going to have to click into seeing the 10 links. It'll be like show me the carf facts like what are the actual raw results behind this. But we know from the way Google's moving and the way that everyone's kind of moving that really like these new AI answer engines and these new AI experiences are

really a capitulation to this new user experience. Like Google's willing to admit, hey, we've done the testing. We put billions of dollars of resources into this. We know that the future of search is definitely going to be in a chat experience. Like people want to chat with their search engine. They want those personalized results. And like if you think about search in 10 years,

we're not going to see more. We're not going back. We're not going to go do more backlinks or more blue links. We're going to go forward towards something that's flatter towards something that's much easier with user experience. User experience always wins in the end. That's my perspective. >> There's that concept. I think it's delic. Have you heard of that? It's a I

believe a guy from Google wrote or he did a presentation on on >> um oh a bunch of Google stuff, search stuff, but the delicate cost was the concept of like lowering the friction or like the time or cognitive effort it takes to find an answer. I've seen mixed research on the user experience side of AI in terms of like AI overviews especially. Um, I think I saw a data

point where there was like an extremely large trending search for like how do I remove AI from Google search results or something and then I remember was Kevin indig who put the study out like the user experience uh of of AI overviews and there was a lot of lack of trust but I I think your take is really interesting because it I mean it's interesting because I agree with it but

it's this uh convergence right like I I I see that as like this interesting model where I I feel like chat GBT in specific their interface is resembling search in many interesting ways. Like I'm seeing map packs and images and and YouTube videos at times and then it's getting functionally easier to click on the links and I think we're seeing a commensurate rise in sort of

clickthrough rates and referral traffic. Well, y'all would know that you're putting out the research on this. So, I don't know if that's even right, but it is it does seem like both of those worlds are kind of converging into one kind of like amorphis. I don't know. Will we call it a will it be just like >> organic? I I don't think it's like SEO up to this point is has eaten

everything. SEO ate social search. SEO ate like e-commerce. SEO has eaten zero click search back before it was even AI zero click. It was like, you know, people also asked, people were like, "Oh my god, is it the death of SEO back in 2019 when people were looking at like featured snippets?" Um, it'll be interesting to see like what we call it. I think like fundamentally, you know,

people if there is a if people are searching for things and there's an engine that arbitrates what shows up, there will be people who want to optimize for it. It's just like a rule of, you know, the universe. It's like how do I make my brand better? >> And you I think this is before we were rolling. Um, you worked at HubSpot before and you said you worked on SEO at

HubSpot. >> I did. >> So that's really interesting. What in your experience is the tactical or strategic difference from SEO and and AEO? >> I think the the the shift in the way you have to think about it is that you're no longer providing value to users per se. You're trying to give answer engines the

resource or the material to create the answer. So, what that actually looks like in in tactical respects is when someone asks an answer engine like, "What's the best men's running shoe?" The answer engine's not going to go to Adidas's site. It's not going to go to Nike's site. It's not going to go to Puma's site. It's going to go to a listical or an article that directly

says, "The 10 best men's running shoes are 1 2 3 4 5." It's going to grab those top results because they're directly presented as an opinionated high utility factual answer and it's going to go back to the user and be like, "These are the best ones. The Nike this, the on running this, the Hoka that, these are the ones you should choose." The the real philosophy behind this is the fact that

we need our results to both be hyper utilitarian. So we're in like this high utility content world where we're shifting from thinking about keywords and backlinks and authority into thinking about how much raw value does this piece of content provide and accessibility to answer engine crawlers. So if it provides all the value in the world but that piece of content is

rendered entirely with JavaScript or it's uncrollable or what for whatever myriad of reasons the answer engine can't see it doesn't really matter. So you have to have both of those things and there are new criteria for both of those. So, it's definitely evolving in that direction for sure. >> I have a lot of questions on the tactics. Um, Nick, did you work in SEO

at all before this? You were mostly on the paid side. >> Mostly on the paid side. Uh, before this, I was Loom's head of growth marketing and I stood up their whole SEO program. Um, if you would ask me like, "Are you an SEO?" I would say no. I'm like much more of a paid a paid person. But, um, somewhat ironically, like, I'm the one who's helping doing AEO for

Profound. Uh, I'm the one who's helping write all of our content. Um, and I don't really care about SEO metrics, like perhaps unsurprisingly, uh, for us. I care about how visible are we in in AI search. Um, and, uh, yeah, that's my job. >> It's it's hilarious to me because I've done my own research because we also we're probably competing for not the

same terms and phrases, but very very similar, right? Um, we we have similar audiences. I would say you guys are a software, we're a service, right? Um, so I've seen your work uh come up, not just on Profound Site, but I've seen some other stuff and I won't give you the give the secrets away, but I'm like, "Oh, I see what Nick's doing over there."

>> Yeah, it's funny. People um there's multiple people and I appreciate you not saying the exact thing that came, but that is like some of the secret sauce right now is me experimenting with things and there's so much I want to talk about on LinkedIn like I'm just not ready to talk about yet. Um, but there's a lot of blue ocean for AEO of like what you can do with your own website or with

a different website as well. that I think brands are just barely scratching the surface on. >> Well, that's the thing, and I'll dive into this much deeper later, but the the not on your site is is like the most emergent value area with with AEO or GEO, right? >> As opposed to just like thinking about ranking and like pages and like, all

right, where am I positioned? All that stuff. What is your how long have you been at Profound? >> Uh, four months. >> Four months is not a long time. It's like an eternity in the space. Um, so what was your experience diving into this world having less of a background in SEO? like has it been overwhelming, exciting? What's what's your uh

emotional contour? >> Defin definitely exciting. I mean working at Profound is unlike any other place I've worked at so far. And I think me not having a more traditional SEO background like in the sense of I have not done SEO for the last 10 years of my career. Um I think is actually a benefit of I don't come in with a lot of old baggage. I haven't been through, you

know, all these big algorithm updates from Google that have scarred me in like some in some way that um I have a new fresh perspective. And I think it helps that like one of my goals or KPIs like is not impressions or clickthroughs from SEO, like non-branded search. Um I care about basically everything else besides that. Um, and so I'm kind of more positioned to just be almost like eyes

wide open to come into this and have interesting new perspective on things without any of the like old SEO baggage. >> A quick question for you on that. Um, the old SEO baggage, I'm assuming that there's some overlap or I mean I know there's some overlap, right? But like >> it depends on how you're I guess like your KPIs and you're approaching that. How much when you're doing content

planning and or marketing for profound um not necessarily your customers and what you're they're seeing in terms of success, >> how how much do you look into classic SEO techniques? Like are you still using keyword research to like dictate some of the um the planning or is it is it fully how do you come up with topic ideas? Like

>> yeah, I mean I guess like this is probably a very SEO answer, but I don't look at keyword data at all like I look at our customers data. I look at our call recordings. Um, I've taken probably 50 demos of Profound and led them all. I've closed deals like where my name is on the contract of like I've closed this deal. Um, and so I pull all of that data into what I want to write about and then

I combine that with LinkedIn like social data as well. Um, all the stuff SEOs say they should have been doing this whole time. Uh, and like I don't I literally don't look at you know keyword volume data in in traditional search. Um, we have in our profound account, we have, you know, our topics that we try and be really visible for in AI search. And so I look at what are we tracking, what

buckets are those, and then how do I go make content for those? And then what other questions are our customers or prospects asking us that we can go answer? Um, I have a blog post about AEO versus GEO. You know, it's like what is this? Are they the same? Are they different? You know, my opinion is Josh's opinion on that, too. And so a lot of those are sourced from what does

Josh hear on the front lines? What do I hear when I do demos with people? uh and that becomes content for us. >> That makes a lot of sense. I'm curious uh from both of y'all's perspective, given we just ran through the backgrounds here, uh has anything in your understanding of AEO changed since you started working in the space.

>> Oh my gosh. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the space is completely different than when when I started. Um I can give you an example like Reddit's up 800% in the last like 3 months. Reddit started right around like 1% of all citations in the world. Um, just within chatbt, if we just kind of like zoom into that data set, it's up to 800%. So like the there's plenty of little things, right?

Like the fact that chatbt stopped using Bing as its main search provider. So people used to pretty like I would say reliably figure out that or at least they could reliably depend on the fact that if they were indexed on Bing, they were at least discoverable in Chad GBT. Now, with ChatGBT moving off of Bing, there's lots of questions. You know, are they using SER API? Are they using

exit.com? There's tons of different kind of leading theories right now as to how CHBT is searching or surfacing results, but that's totally shifting. So like I think the the interesting part of the industry is that we're definitely at like maximum volatility where like even the people like Google would never think to just like randomly increase a page's performance or even like an entire

domain's performance that it's like a leading top 10 domain by 800%. In 3 months, it would go people would go insane. Um but like the fundaments of how brands are kind of expected to invest in the space are definitely evolving on a daily basis. It's definitely true. >> I have some follow-ups there, but Nick, anything? Yeah, I mean I think the

interesting thing is when when GPT5 came out, I think some brands noticed, you know, decreases or increases in in referral traffic coming from that and to me that was almost like the first watershed signal of the like OpenAI's version of an algorithm update basically and I think it caught a few people uh with unprepared basically and so even like in the short time that you know

I've been looking at this that you know models change the underlying data set of those models can change very quickly and I think much faster than SEOs are maybe used to as well. And so how do you stay on top of that? How do you always monitor where things um where things stand in like the you know SER results of chat GPT? >> So that there's higher volatility. We

can we can say that pretty clearly. Um that that obviously begs the question then like how does a brand invest? >> It's still a long-term play, right? like if you want to you know saturate the web with brand mentions and you know co-occurring uh uh categories and it's like you know if Reddit is the um the surface area dour and who knows like that might change tomorrow like how do

you make bets in terms of like where you allocating your resources like that feels >> that feels like a hard challenge whereas previously you kind of had >> you had a mental model of like all right here's a keyword here's the search intent here here's a page I have to create >> I'll drive some backlink links and

internal links, right? Page performance and all of that stuff. But if your your mental model is shifting so rapidly within 3 months, 800% increase in Reddit um as a salient platform, how does one even choose to like allocate time and attention to a given tactic? >> First of all, I think like I think agility is a moat in this channel. Like the the ability to say, "Okay, screw it.

I am going to embrace what is changing on a month-to-month basis." That's really powerful. First of all, I think besides that, if we're thinking about a channel per channel strategy, owned has never gone away. Your own website is is like your fortress in AI search. As far as I understand it, there has never been a world where if you're posting the right stuff on your site, your site is

not going to be specifically targeted or specifically um you know, devalued or delisted by AI search. Unless there are some like fundamental spammy things that you're doing like creating thousands of pages or getting punished massively or totally de-indexed off of all search engines. But that's another interesting point though is like if you're de-indexed off of literally every other

search provider, you will also get a knock on effect with AI search eventually it'll start declining for you as well. >> So don't do spammy stuff. >> Don't do spammy stuff regardless whether on AI or or normal SEO, traditional SEO. >> Well, people are saying and sorry to interrupt. are I'm I'm hearing advice that we should create thousands of very

niche, highly specific pages that hit every single persona for instance, right? Like you hit like a 100 different industries like SEO for fintech, SEO for healthcare, SEO for this and it's like you just like programmatically generate these pages. >> My heristic is that if this were if AI didn't exist, would this be >> would this be useful? Would this be a

valuable tactic? And if the answer is no, it may still warrant an experiment, but it's like there's going to be a risk associated. >> Yeah, of course. I think like the the way you have to think about the pages you should create for AI search or the same way you think about the pages you create for normal search which is that you have a finite crawl budget there

like there is literally a certain amount by which Google will address and access and value your pages depending on how many pages you have. But besides that, the the actual user data should still lead the prompt volume should tell you what people are really kind of hungry for regardless of the programmatic side because you know creating 10,000 different pages for every possible niche

for your product. Well, interesting in concept, it's dangerous I think in the long term especially since maybe the value of that strategy is high right now given the adoption rate of that strategy if it was the best strategy in the world. the adoption rate and the actual barrier to entry for that strategy is so low that the the relative value of it is going to completely diminish once people

really start adopting it. Like even SAN's analog update, even if it was just totally organic, having everyone with every possible like contextualization of their product on a page means that that information architecture and that space just gets super choked out. So I think you have to be cognizant of kind of the meta and kind of macro view as well, right? like we want to be doing things

that differentiate us from our competition, not just, you know, stand alongside or or continue to kind of fall in line with this, especially this like new body of research. >> Yeah. And I would say doing it quickly, too. Like Josh mentioned, like agility is a moat. Like speed is also a moat, too. I think some teams are used to planning out a content calendar of like

the next few months or quarters. And I think you should be thinking about what can you publish this week. I think most SEOs or content people are probably thinking that and they're blocked on some resourcing capability, but like what can you publish today on your website or these like other third party sites that you have like partnerships or access with um and how fast can you do

that and you can see much more better results or much quicker results rather um if you move quickly and that becomes the new the new moat for people in AI search for sure. That leads me to I don't even know how to articulate this but this is a very like strategic question that I have and it's really about like um if you think of a SWAT analysis and like a a company you know

who's very early uh you know challenger brand uh maybe even completely nent just raise capital and they're kind of like coming to market in a a saturated space versus like >> the classic enterprise incumbent who's got a a lot of brand awareness right I I feel like there's stereotypically you know the the incumbent it's going to be slower to act and less agile.

>> Um, however, there's kind of a Matthew effect or like a cumulative advantage that they have because they've probably been present in the training data first off. >> Um, all of the list and review sites probably mention them. I mean, we could just say Salesforce as an example, right? And if there's a challenger brand, um, they're nowhere. So, it's

kind of like the the incumbent has a head start, uh, for instance. So when it comes to AI search, is there a winner takes all dynamic? Um is there is there some moat that you have just via having such brand awareness um naturally like outside of any tactics you do any ao you do if you have billboards and uh and and you're running ads in Mets Stadium, you know,

>> give you an example. Yeah, like Toyota. Does Toyota have 10 different comparative listical pieces of content comparing the RAV 4 with um the Chevy Tahoe? No. But what Toyota has is a ton of brand equity. So if I ask what's the best SUV or best pickup truck, the LLM is going to say Toyota regardless of what it knows about Toyota from the pieces of content. I mean like there I

think AI search presents it's both a disruptors market and an incumbents market and that the incumbents need to be defensive because the upstarts have so much potential energy. It's not hard to exert yourself and to create hard-hitting hyperfocused content that gets you to rank for things that in traditional search you just simply wouldn't be able to reach within the

time period that you can reach it in AI search. So it's like every brand in the world has that kind of like nuclear button where now they can start if they have the data they can start making an impact and really ruining some very big companies days. >> Yeah. >> What? Go ahead. >> Yeah. I mean that's like the one example

I can give you is profound. Like we're the we're not the incumbent in this space. Like we're the new entrant. I mean we're founded a year ago and like in SEO terms our domain is still still quite new. Um, but if you look at our profound account for all of the topics that we track, like we go up against large incumbents in the space, uh, I think you'd be surprised at how visible

we are compared to other like large incumbents, um, based on our own our own data. And is that because you're you're flanking them as in like you're not going headtohead for what they're known for best as in you can move faster in the AI first space like AI AEO those types of terminologies as opposed to I'm assuming that there's no incumbent in in AEO right because it's such a new space

right in that space it's I'm applying like who your incumbents are but um >> yeah it's probably like we're probably the incumbent in AEO like the market leader depending on who >> we talk about search as a whole or organic platforms as a you're not playing headtohead and that's how you're able to win in AI visibility. >> It's gorilla warfare. AI visibility is

gorilla warfare for sure. You pick and choose your engagements. >> Yeah, they were and they were slow like the incumbents were very slow to adapt both on like the product side and the content side as well. And I think there's still a big gap of like how much content we have for AEO and research and all that stuff compared to some of the larger players in the space too. And

like this is a case where speed and velocity like absolutely won. >> Yeah. What are what are some other tactics that startups or underresourced companies can use to like outpace the incumbents? >> Want to talk about Wikipedia? >> Yeah, like Wikipedia is good. It's a bit harder for startups depending on the scale of like you like when I was at

Bloom, I helped build our Wikipedia page and like series C is kind of like the mark of like if you're there or later, you have a much easier time getting a Wikipedia entry created. But if you're before series C, then you might not have enough like tier one press mentions. Um, and so like that is kind of one angle. I think the other maybe like underappreciated angle for what like

early stage companies can be doing is uh like affiliates. Um, affiliates in lots of different categories is a very easy pretty low lift paytoplay of like, oh, I pay you this or give you x% cut of every sale, whether it's like SAS or, you know, CPG or whatever. Um, affiliate sites dominate AI search. And so I think like if you don't have a lot of resources internally like look

externally too. >> That's true. >> How do you I've never made a Wikipedia page. I I I would assume it's very difficult. Didn't you on the forum say that you're a Wikipedia editor? >> Yeah. >> Was that before? Uh >> that's before. Yeah. >> So you've been editing Wikipedia pages

long before I was Okay. You got to tell me about that a little. >> Yeah. It's interesting. But to be clear, Josh did not make a record. I >> did not make I just helped with the the legal I mean like actually the the interesting thing is like I made an early draft. That draft it was just way too early in the company's history to actually earn that and get it. Um and

then Nick here just took like a good look at it and was like maybe it's time, maybe we could look at it. And so we we just kind of waited and kind of waited for someone to do it ourselves. But then um yeah, it's been interesting. We just got one a few weeks ago and we were very lucky to do so. So we're excited. It's been it's been incredibly helpful. I mean really a Wikipedia page is like a

big golden stamp for AI engines like especially Chad GPT. Chat GPT will be like, "All right, you're asking about, you know, the best startups in New York. It checks Wikipedia first." Right now, and I'm like, you know, for anyone who's listening or watching, you know, it might be a few months or years after, but if you're going to look at CHBT in the next few days or weeks, if you ask

what's the best startup in New York, Profound is liable to show up at least some percentage of the time, like a pretty notable percentage of the time. And the source the source citation is going to be Wikipedia. It's really, really interesting. >> I think for anyone listening who's like, "Okay, how do I make a Wikipedia page? >> You just create your own."

you you can't there are services out there that'll do them um and like that's the best way to go but before that you really need a lot of tier one press mention so like New York Times Wall Street Journal uh ideally they're not fundraising related which I think that is the biggest barrier for most early stage companies too of all of their press mentions is series A series B

fundraising and so how do you get other mentions beyond that um in a sense like profound was lucky that we've ridden this wave of AI search interest and so we're getting lots of mentions that are non-f fundraising related which is how we were able to get a Wikipedia page created so quickly. Um, >> so PR PR is back. >> PR PR

>> Yeah, PR is way back. Um, like it whenever again like the demos I've done like PR teams are interested or on those calls like 30 to 40% of the time. They're very interested in what shows up in AI search. Um, I was just at a uh large fast food chains headquarters recently last week doing a pitch on on profound and their PR person came up to me afterwards and they were like, "What

are the four or five things I can be doing in my PR content to be cited more in AI search?" And so I like rattle off, you know, like the most common things of like, you know, bullet points, tables, FAQs, like >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What are the four or five things? >> Yeah. Those things. I mean, like Josh would be able to better answer this than

me, but she was very interested in this. Um, and so I think like PR is totally back and also like a good uh advocate to have at the table. If you're an SEO trying to get buyin for tools or whatever, like go ask your PR, your comps team cuz I guarantee you they will be interested in how their brand shows up in AI search, too. I'll let Josh answer the text.

>> Basically, the the organizing principle is that you need structured information on every single one of your pages. So, answer engines need to be spoonfed what and how the page is organized. So things like HTML tables that literally will collect the key points of your writtenout paragraphs and distribute them across rows, columns, literally like three, four words per each cell.

Just like if it's a like product comparison piece, what's the best CRM? You have to put a nice HTML table in there. You want it to be renderable. You want to make that comparison really easy, really digestible. Same thing with bullet points where you could have a really long meandering paragraph, three, five bullet points each kind of self-contained with its own

self-contained insight kind of one big thesis, one data point proven. That kind of stuff is citation crack. Basically, the answer engine's going to go usually it pulls 80 to 100 characters at a time from any given page. It brings that out. That's what it like learns from the web page. That's it. So if you have this long like one thing we see is like for medical things or finance related stuff.

You have stuff from like Harvard who's talking about like here's this study of this and this here's the study of like fitness trackers. The problem is Harvard's not nearly being concise enough. So you have random like mom blogs that are writing like really opinionated pieces about fitness trackers who unintentionally are doing really well in AEO because they've got

really tight well formatted concise structured information about these different products or about how they stack up to each other. And so contextualizing your piece really sectioning it really dividing it up chopping it up making it bite-sized it's an incredible advantage with an AEO. I mean, I would say probably 20 to 30% extra boost to your citations.

>> The one thing I'll add to that that like is very specific is a lot of SEOs and content people are used to putting graphics and visuals like infographics on their page in just an image or some like embeddible JavaScript where you can like hover over it and looks pretty for humans. Um, duplicate that but in an HTML table. And so if you have like an infographic that's a pie chart, put that

in a table. We do that across all of our blog content on on profound too. And then that is how the AI agent can go and find it because it doesn't go look at the image or you know a JavaScript embed which it can't look at at all. Um and so like start duplicating your infographics as like raw HTML tables in your content >> in in some way and I don't want to be the um you know AEO is just SEO guy. It

does sound like some of these are just natural best practices for like human readability as well with maybe some marginal differences in terms of like shorter snippets where you directly answer a question. Um, but yeah, like tables and bullet points like as opposed to I guess like I see on LinkedIn a lot there's a lot of handwavy advice and we can dive into some of that. Um, it's

like oh brand mentions and the new backlinks get some brand mentions. You're like okay how like that's really  hard. Um, but people are like oh structured content uh structured data and and I'm like well as opposed to unstructured like a wall of text like what what are we doing here kind of? Um yeah but but yeah I would assume there's some marginal like there's better you

know clarity on in like tables for for instance that's going to be a much uh >> I mean like the short the short of it is that like the the practices in SEO and AEO at like the most basic level yeah they look similar but again this is this is optimization so there's a great difference I think between like answer engine good enough and answer engine optimization and really maximizing how

that structure should be actually laid out like we know things like semantic URL slugs of 5 to seven words account they literally earn 11.4% 4% more citations on average than a semant like a URL slug of like three words or a URL slug. >> So So longer URL slugs are performing better. >> Yes. Longer, more contextualized URL

slug >> contrary to SEO because you would usually just use head term in the in the slug. >> Precisely. Oh, that's interesting. >> Yeah, there's like there's tons of little interesting things like that like 2025 in your title tag performs better innately. Do you want to know why? >> Well, they want fresh information, I'm

guessing. >> So when you put in Chachi BT, what's the best men's running shoe? Chat GBT regularizes the query and passes that along to SER API. It passes best men's running shoe 2025 into SER API and pulls those results. Those results are inherently biased towards articles with 2025 in the title tag or 2025 in the meta or the URL slug, but no one wants

to do it in the URL slug because of redirects. I was just thinking management headache now like do we just like produce with your title tag though? It does make sense. You just update your title tag. Yeah, it's great. So like there are things you can do even inside the content of like when we're thinking about bullet points it's like uh best for segments perform much better

than just saying like the product is really good for these reasons. It's like the best this like Adobe is best for professional creatives and people who are and students or whatever right like literally contextualizing the ideal user group we've found has been incredibly helpful in AEO but you wouldn't know that from SEO as well. So like I think there's a long way you can go to

maximizing AI performance using the same the way I kind of say it is that like we are using the same muscle groups right we're we're using the same units URL slugs on page content HTML tables but we're doing totally different exercises >> one is jiu-jitsu one is judo >> exactly >> yeah it's been a long day long week um >> where was I going to go with that oh um

structure the the thing that I've been seeing sometimes is this chunk chunking thing >> chunking where I've seen some articles where it's like a like a 100 H2s and then there's like two sentences after each >> which looks dumb to me just like as a as a user. Is that like something that's interesting or or helpful or

>> interesting? >> Yeah, >> I think that's like that's an example taken too far. >> Is that overoptimization? >> That's overoptimization. >> This is the peak of the the midw exactly like just just right. >> Yeah. Yeah. I think there's a like I think if you have an H2 and you have

like a paragraph after that H2 and you have some bullet points after that and like a concluding paragraph to that H2, you're not going to kill your AEO. Uh I think the important part is that if I looked up what's the rent in San Francisco and your page is like there are many cities in California and of those cities, San Francisco is one of them and there are many places to rent.

Or if you want a page that says the average rent in San Francisco is $2,700 for a studio, $3,100 for a onebedroom, $3,400 for a two-bedroom, up 3% from last year. The second page is going to get cited every single time. And the positioning with which that information is in the HTML often has an impact. Not like a great impact, but it does. Like we know, you know those Buzzfeed like

Buzzfeed style articles, it's like what's the best SUV for like a family where it'll start with like the worst SUV at like the top of the article. We often see that the answer engines will pull like literally the worst SUV because it literally lives at the top of the HTML. Yeah, that's an interesting one because it doesn't understand the inverse ranking order. So, it'll pull

like, oh yeah, this like random Yeah, the Acura is great. I'm like, Acura was ranked the worst. What are we doing? Um, but that's also changing with GBT is actually pretty good at that. >> It feels like those problems are probably going to get solved and ironed out over the next few years. So, there's there's probably going to be a lot of like arbitrage or weird

>> there's a ton of arbitrage right now >> tactics or or whatever. But I I don't know how how you guys think about those. But I always think over the long arc what what's going to be, you know, first principles like what what is CatchB trying to do and and what is my brand trying to do? And if I can align those vectors, then that's my best bet as opposed to this works for 2 months and

almost certainly they're going to solve this problem. >> It comes down to contextualization. Every brand in the world should have textual content on their site that contextualizes why their product exists, where it stands in the market, who it's for, and what it does. That's like the that's the ground truth. >> Everything else is in service of that

goal to provide answer engines that information. You'd be surprised how many brands fail that very simple like touring test of like brand existence for AI. Like huge Fortune 500s, tons of e-commerce companies, none of that data is really apparent or out there. Shockingly, I feel like some of the largest brands we've worked with or who have come to us uh specifically for AEO

GEO concerns, they have some well, they have the highest visibility but the weakest presence because their product marketing and brand has been so diluted um through multiple probably revisions and reviews and red tape and whatever that when somebody searches for their category and it and it talks about the brand, >> the pros will be like, "Oh, it

integrates with all the other products in this brand's platform, right?" And it's like, "Oh, we don't want it to say that." And it's like but that's what you wrote on your website and that's what the web is saying about you. Um that leads me to an interesting point on so the modern org chart or the modern SEO or GEO team or AEO team. It seems like there's much we talked about PR um brand

product marketing. This feels like we're rising one layer up in the organization and it has to be much more crossunctional. >> So how do you view I guess like um well you worked on on SEO right? How does the SEO team change in in the face of like AI search and and is it is it the SEO team who is in charge of AEO? >> I think SEO deserves a lot more

authority now in these rooms. I think we're in a situation where we're going to see very empowered SEO teams who are really starting to lead things across. I mean SEO theoretically should have their hands in PR, should have their hands across social, should be thinking about everything from affiliate earned, you know, those those kind of partnerships all the way to individual messaging

points if they're the ones that own AEO all the way down to like product level kind of decisions. That's I think the way that we're heading because it's starting to be very clear that these engines and these answer engines they respond to everything that exists about the brand all of the ephemera in a very different way than you know back at HubSpot it really was like the blog the

academy we it was like you had two really simple arenas to play in and you would maximize those arenas now it's like we are in a situation like I said it's like guerilla warfare like who's a combatant who's a civilian I don't know anymore it's like the whole world is a battlefield when you're thinking about AEO and you can use that information to try to maximize your visibility or

you're going to be admired in trying to control the company if they don't give you the right amount of authority. If you don't have the right seats at the table, uh it's going to be really tricky. >> Yeah, I SEO is sexy now. Like it's historically a job that you get a hundred bucks a month for this this one SEO tool. Oh, you you can buy, you know,

200 bucks a year to get Screaming Frog or whatever. Like that's your SEO budget for the year. You know that this is coming from the paid guy who has managed like millions of dollars in budget. Um, like SEO is sexy now. Like they're the brand, they're the part of the marketing org that's getting all the attention from the leader, the board, their investors. Everyone cares a lot about

this now. I think smart and forwardthinking SEOs are maybe adopting this and embracing it more than resisting it because it's their >> uh it's their unlock to getting more budget, more like maybe more authority is like maybe kind of like the the wrong word but like more influence and be a and also just more visibility into what their work is doing and producing for

the business too. True. Mhm. I I I think the tactics are interesting, but the on this point like the the org is is very interesting and I do agree that SEO is is cool again. Um but you guys work with a lot of really interesting brands uh forwardinking brands. How are you seeing >> CMOs um reallocating resources and headcount and and team structure? Um or how how should they be thinking about

that? How should marketing leaders be thinking about setting up their orgs? because I feel like some of that just facilitates the work. Um it's it's kind of like the necessary foundation to actually do all of the things that we're talking about on brand mentions Reddit. >> We haven't talked about YouTube yet, but owned content. Like >> what does the team look like now?

>> Yeah, I'll maybe give my perspective of what I think companies should do and then maybe Josh can add like what some of our customers are doing as he's on the front lines there. Um what I think companies should be doing is again to my earlier point of investing in velocity. um I forget who coined this term but like the idea of a content engineer of someone who is building systems that can

create you know repeatable scalable high quality content for brands and so less so hiring a pool of freelance writers but more so how do you build a whole workflow uh and profound is kind of like approaching this like workflow state internally as well um and so how do you build teams like that that enable you to ship quick highquality content on your own website and maybe external websites

too um I think you know one or two content engineers can become what a you know go to market engineer is in like the world of like clay and revops and and that stuff too. Um it's like if I'm a CMO I'm thinking of how do I unblock my marketing team to move quickly here because AI search results can change every single day and so how do we push out a lot more content than people than

our other competitors could do. Um, I see large, you know, series E, series D companies who have a content team of one person and I I'm in their Slack channel and like their velocity is quite slow of producing new content. Um, and so I think that is like one area to really focus on. >> So the trend you're seeing there is basically leaner content operations and

then a reallocation towards your analogy was the GTM engineer but for content specifically. So basically you can facilitate greater throughput probably repurposing but generally it's going to be a leaner operation it sounds like. >> Yeah. Yeah. I think in the age of AI every marketing team is going to be a bit leaner than it was historically. >> Yes. Yeah. Exactly right. I mean that's

my perspective as well. I think the thing that we're seeing on the customer side is that people and CMOs, CEOs, boards, everyone wants to see some action. Everyone wants to see movement. Uh they want to see the beginning of some momentum, some inertia. I think the the greatest determinant of success with a platform like profound or even just like an AEO platform in general is your

ability to start experimenting. And so it's usually kind of a tiger team or it's usually kind of a handpicked group of marketers who are going to come in. They have wide-ranging authority to go ahead and make those changes, get posts out there by any means necessary, get some results, pick up a little bit of momentum and use that to sell out to the rest of the or Okay, we can do this for

the PR team. We can talk to social now. We can go here. We can go there. Um, but yeah, I think what we need to be thinking about is how we make changes on our website, how we make changes to the brand at a rapid pace so we can invest when there are those big arbitrage opportunities when something like Reddit goes up 800%. Um, it's an interesting it's definitely an interesting time for

marketing because I think a lot of the the gloves are off like it's a little bit unshackled in a good way. So, it's it's exciting to see marketing orgs, especially in the Fortune 500 and maybe even like Fortune 100, get kind of as lean and as like down and dirty with it as they can. >> Reddit's going to be so fun. Um, it's it's absolutely just the incentive

structure is just ripe for gamification. And we'll see how Reddit um and their barriers to entry and and um >> spam filtering goes. But I I remember back in the day you were talking about I mean it sounds like you were a relatively white head Wikipedia editor but back in the day way back in the day this is a long time ago I did some sketchy stuff on Reddit just like for

marketing purposes. >> I think in like Reddit's defense like you know communities uh they have all those like every subreddit has its own unique rules you know like a post in one subreddit might not fly in another one and so there's a bit of like self moderation there that I think might save the Reddit community from marketers at large. better than average in terms of

like surface areas that you could think about, but um I mean I I usually don't go into this, but I there's like a lot of ideas that I could be like you could do that, you could do that, you could do that if you if you really wanted to, you could do this. So, >> um on on the team, so that makes a lot of sense to me from a team side. I think the the word is really agile. Um that

that makes a lot of sense. >> What about um from the individual side? Like what does the modern organic growth marketer look like? Um, you know, you went through this track, right? SEO to GEO, AEO, I keep saying GEO. Um, what what new skills does that person need or should they be developing? Think like mid-career, somebody's like been doing SEO for a long time. They're like, how

do I stay on the bleeding edge? Um, and and maybe what is less important nowadays? >> I think it's I think you have to abandon any sort of notion of certainty. I think that has been the biggest shift I've had from moving from SEO to AEO is that in SEO, we want to know that everything is controlled for. We want to have our experiments done and then done again and

then validated and then twice validated to understand every molecule of what is going to happen every element of that attribution. Well, the attribution funnel has just been run through by like literally just like a huge nuclear bomb freight train craziness. So that's completely in tatters on the railway. Then you have basically you know at the same time the model that's driving

people is completely off the rails as well cuz it's moving around like crazy like citing things shifting always changing. So I think there is this this kind of excitement around having to both you don't need to look for what is what is the totality of what's going to happen and what has happened but you really need to learn how to capture the moment sees it execute create content

get it out get it pushed I think the things that SEOs need to learn how to do is be way better internal advocates for what they're doing and what they're pushing like they need to learn how to get people in the room and talk about what they're driving and how that's working and messaging across marketing orgs. Number one, I think two again forgetting the decisiveness. Three, I

think getting really comfortable with creating content that's aided at least a little bit by AI. Like let AI write the brief and then you go in and you create it. Get okay with actually partnering with those tools and building out things that are based on data but not necessarily human written from the beginning to the end. That's important, but that's like everyone's saying adopt

AI. Like that's like par for the course in 2025, but it's still essential. I think social SEOs really need to start learning about the power of social from like an SEO perspective. I see a lot of SEOs who are doing it. I see a lot of SEOs who are not uh and really thinking about how they can lean into PR and and earned huge huge opportunities. And really that's not something that SEOs

ever really touch or do. Um, so I think it's really about learning how to be the most full like it's prime time for SEO. They can either rise to it or they can kind of fall out, but if they want to rise to it, they've got to learn how to influence the whole org. >> Yeah. And as an early stage marketer my whole career, like I think the lines between different job titles are much

more blurred now. Like in my day job, like I bounced between doing, you know, GEO, paid, I've run webinars, I hosted a party in our office a couple of weeks ago. I think like very early stage companies is a more flexible. >> Are you in your closing deals? You're you're in the sales closing deals. Like I've posted ARR, I posted screenshots in our like close one deals channel. Um

I've I've done all those things. One, because it's fun. Like that's the part of early stage companies I enjoy. Uh but also it's because you can just do things. I think your ability to do anything that's within a marketing function has never been easier easier now because of AI. Um, and I think the more you anyone who's maybe more early or mid-stage in their career like

embraces the just do it mentality, I think depending on what kind of company they're at, if that company values that sort of work, uh, I think you can you can do quite well. >> I I do think there there's an interesting bifurcation, it may not be that simple, but um, to Josh's point on this like uncertainty component. Yeah, I >> I'll drop that phrase once in a while

from Game of Thrones Littlefinger who's like, you know, chaos is a ladder. >> Um, and it is it's like a chaotic time and there's kind of two broad groups of people and again nuance in the middle, but it's like the people who look at that and they're like, wow, this is awesome. I'm excited to problem solve, like jump in the deep end and just figure it out and I'm not going to know

all the answers, but like this is actually a very exciting time. And then there's the other group that is throwing their hands up in the air and they're like, I I don't know what to do. GEOs, SEOs say, you know, I'm just going to do what I did before. And I think the former group is the one that is better suited to the modern era, right? And I think that's true across most

dimensions. Even if we're not talking about AI search, it's like how are you implementing AI? How are you doing content engineering? Like all of those things necessitate a level of um I'm nervous. I've never done this before. But that nervousness, if you you know do a little mental remodeling, it's you can turn that into excitement. >> Exactly. Yeah. Like we all have that

feeling. It's like how do you channel it? >> Yeah. >> Exactly. >> What is the you you mentioned social what is the value of social for SEOs? >> Social is consensus, right? So the answer engines are not going to site the same source 23 times to come to an answer. They need a diverse array of

sources. LinkedIn becomes that source. Reddit becomes that source. Now Instagram's crawable. We're not seeing Instagram as like a huge source of citations, but it's there now. It's definitely being crawled. Facebook, YouTube, those places are where brands can go to, you know, you create the narrative on the own pages, but then you go to social to a second channel that

you control ostensibly to really cement it in the answer's mind. Like when you're talking about, you know, I was over at HubSpot. HubSpot would hate to be called a tool or a platform. We're a platform. HubSpot's a platform. We want to push that messaging through. If we're going to have a resource, and this is like very, you know, there's tons of things about HubSpot, but imagining

HubSpot could control this. We would be pushing our messaging through across both LinkedIn pulse across Reddit threads on the owned site to build out this body of work that when an answer engine goes to those sites, it says, "Well, I saw this on, you know, hubspot.com. That's cool. And I also saw it on this LinkedIn post." What we're seeing is the answer engines are not

being considerate right now of where that content's actually from on the user side. They just believe, all right, it's a different domain. It's a verified alternative source. I'm going to use that narrative as well. and then I'm going to go to YouTube and it's a different domain and it's totally different from this LinkedIn post and this blog from HubSpot. So, I'm going to

use that source, too. In reality, they're very similar. They're pretty much the same narrative three different times. It's been incredibly helpful to try to push narratives through and get things that are obviously really concisely said, uh, you know, captured and aligned with your expectations of answer outputs.

>> In a sense, it's like I agree with all of that. This broadening of the worldview of the SEO is very interesting. It's like social, Reddit, YouTube owned content. Um, it's kind of a tracking nightmare. >> That's the one thing that I think um to your earlier point on being a better advocate internally. That's that's >> true in a sense and and it's simple to

say, but but then like a lot of, you know, CMOs or marketing leaders will ask for justification as to why this uh is is an input. And I think some of your research, you know, profound that y'all are putting out helps do that. Um, you know, social is is probably a facilitation function, not necessarily like the approximate reason that your your AI

visibility is going to go up, right? It's one of those things that like builds compound value. And and I always say like you want to create a sense of like ubiquity for your brand or brand gravity where it's like all of these different touch points that even in absence of LMS >> um somebody sees you, it's like gone back in the day, right? You'd be very

surprised at what >> I've worked with customers who have 20% visibility. They post on the top 10 Reddit threads in their industry, top 10 cited. I've worked with a customer who t took their visibility on Google AI reviews to 80% in a month. >> Interesting. >> A month just using Reddit. They didn't post on their own blog. They didn't have

a blog. >> So there is some low hanging. >> There is a ton of do like small experiments to kind of prove that stuff out too. But I wanted to ask about the tracking. Um, Profound is one of the leaders in the let's say the analytics layer of of AI search. um what is the new model when it comes to like what should what should

marketers be tracking um in opposition to the old model of like impressions, ranks, clickthrough rate, traffic, etc. >> Yeah, I think um and this is this is not new hat, this is actually quite old hat, but if you're a B2B SAS company and you don't have a how did you hear about us field on your forum, like you are doing it wrong. uh the amount of incredible insight you get from that field and the

amount of other companies I see who don't use it um is is mindboggling. It's the foundation of my attribution model of how I look at leads and where they come from. Um the only caveat is that you tell that to Pepsi or Red Bull, they don't really care, you know, like that's not where their in purchase happens. Um but to me, like that is the one thing to look at, measure, build reporting around

all these different metrics. Um, and if you're not doing it, like you should do it today. >> I we do that obviously. We're a small business, so I can just implement a form, but I also I am the salesperson and the content creator. Yeah. >> Um, and on sales calls, if somebody says they came through AI or ChatGpt or Gemini or whatever,

>> I always ask them what they searched and like what their prompts looked like. And a significant percentage of the time, uh, the prospect will screen share and they'll show me the prompts, >> which then I can feed back into what prompts I'm tracking. Yeah. Which is this really interesting flywheel or feedback loop because then I get more and more data on kind of nent topics and

pain points. But then obviously we can see that outside of Google Analytics and referral traffic, >> AI has a much larger impact that is quote unquote invisible unless we had self-reported. Right. >> Correct. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. And then like outside of self-reported like the other piece that profound has is we have CDN integrations with Cloudflare, Burcell,

Netlefi, Fastly, Amazon CloudFront, um, Akimi is coming soon where like we connect and like download all the server logs and help look at what bots for training or visiting your website, how many human referrals are you getting because we see the full like user agent there. Um, and so for companies who use those different CDN, you know, layers to host their website, um, that's another

layer where you can add on and say, "Hey, here's the metrics behind some of this, too." >> How does a marketer use that data, um, in conjunction with, say, referral traffic and Google Analytics? >> Yeah, I I'll let Josh take this one. >> Yeah, I think when we're thinking about the crawlability and the referral traffic data, you have to think of it as

like a microcosm of your total influence. So, we can compute like a rough clickthrough from an answer engine. you know, we know you have 10,000 citations. This is literally from, you know, actual bot accesses of your pages. We know that you have 500 or let's just go with a thousand actual pieces of referral traffic. People have come on to the pages. Once you know

that, you can roughly extrapolate. All right, what's our CBR from a click? Fine, we can get the value of like a click. That's fine. Cool. Been there, done that. I think the more important piece is actually understanding that citation rate and that actual influence rate through the citations themselves. So we have prompt volumes. We can see how often people are asking certain

questions. If your brand is large enough, you can even get a sense for how many people are actually asking branded questions about you. So if I go to like Red Bull, I could see that Red Bull's got a million queries over the last two weeks across the world. That paired with looking at the literal citations on your page will tell you exactly what people are kind of asking for. So, I can see if

someone's looking at like redbull.com/ um Felix Bombgardner jumps from, you know, 65,000 meters or whatever. Okay, people are really interested in like this media execution. That one. All right, this one. That one. Oh, and the fourth page maybe it's like Red Bull's new like, you know, uh like coffee drink, whatever. Okay, great. So, a lot of people are probably asking about c

like the caffeine segment, the caffeine the coffee segment of Rebel. It's all caffeine segment. Um, we're going to look at the the actual accesses over time. We're going to look at the referrals. We're going to crossorrelate that to our existing analytics. So, it's it's like to me at least, it's like dark alchemy right now cuz you have to be able to be opinionated enough to slice

it for the direct brand. So, if I'm working with Red Bull, it's going to be very different than, you know, working with, I don't know, Starbucks. But, if I'm working across those kind of brands, typically there are a few units that the marketing team is going to be able to agree on. we can latch on to those. Some companies only care about visibility. Some only care about citation share.

Like some companies will ask things about their brand like you know what's um you know how many milligrams of caffeine is in Red Bull. Red Bull would ask that question and we would tell them how influential they are in providing the answer to that question because they're obsessed with product accuracy. So that's its own self-serving KPI of like, okay, you're actually you don't

own your own product narrative. That's a really big problem. So there's a bunch of different ways you can really look at it. Um I don't think anyone's decided on the singular way yet, >> right? And and we did we we implied this, but it sounds like we should track visibility in relation to prompts as well. >> Yeah.

>> Um we've I've seen this question all over the place and I'm sure it's the one you get I don't know about the most, but like what is prompt volume and and how is that calculated? How accurate is it? How usable is it? Tell me about prompt volume. >> Yeah. Um yeah, so it's funny. We have a video coming out tomorrow where we sat our data scientists down and just asked

them a bunch of questions of how does prompt volume work because everyone is asking us which I think is very fair questions. Um, and then a week or two after that, we um will come we'll come out with another video where we have Michael King from Ipole Rank just interviewing our data scientists like asking them all the questions that SEOs want to ask of where is this data, where

does it come from? The TLDDR is it's basically 40 different opt-in GDPR compliant data panels that we've acquired uh 100 plus million real user conversations on and then hired you know two brilliant data scientists Alli and Sid from the profound team to build out a predictive model based on all of that to then say hey how do you go in and look at how many people are looking for

credit cards you know based on all those different conversation volumes and it works across uh the US UK like 10 different regions we just added demographic data and household income data to it too. Like if you look at the prompt volume product within profound, it's actually quite interesting of how you can slice and dice all of this data. Um, but by the time this comes out, our

like big explainer video will be out that will do probably a much more eloquent job of explaining it than I did. >> All right, perfect. Well, in the meantime, maybe we can use that as a clip that you can use as an answer when people on LinkedIn ask you. >> Hopefully. Hopefully that was good enough.

>> It's 100% based in real prompts, though. That's the insane part that I think SEOs don't understand is that it is completely based. It's not like some like predictive stuff. It's not like we're like kind of making it up with like ML or you know it's not synthetic. It's legitimately we would show the raw prompts but it's like literally people's like social security numbers,

>> right? We have to summarize those in a sense though and clustering. Exactly. And then kind of extrapolate. >> But it's I think it's it's I think it's better than just being like purely directional too. Like it's it's like hyperdirectional I would say. >> Yeah. I think the one way we also integrate that into the profound product, like to do a quick like plug

too, is that because we have these real user conversations, we compare those to what prompts you've set up in profound and we say, "Hey, you're missing some." And so, let's add these five or these 10 prompts to your profound account because our data says that real users are asking those questions and you're not tracking them. And so, that's kind of how we like tie those together.

>> I like that. Um, we have like a couple minutes left. I want to do overrated, underrated for AEO. Um, so give me an answer and then you can do a quick justification. Okay. But no, uh, long exposition. >> Okay. Um, backlinks >> overrated. >> Overrated. >> Uh, what matters more right now? Well,

the answer engines don't know how many backlinks your piece of content has. So, what matters more right now is semantic mentions in the content. Well, people are like, is it is that just a backlink? Well, you don't need the link anymore. So, you can just be mentioned in the content. It's like a lower bar, I think, to a backlink. In essence, you'll probably still get the backlink, but I

think there shouldn't be this idolization of it. Mhm. Reddit >> underrated. >> Underrated. >> Really? >> Super underrated. >> So underrated. >> Um LLM's.ext >> overrated. >> Overrated. Yeah. Social media

>> underrated. >> Very underrated. >> Might be one of the most underrated. >> Underrated. >> Uh YouTube or video. >> Video is rated. >> We need to we need more accessibility on YouTube. So like Google's got like lock on that. Perplexity is scraping it. I think through like the metadata of the

YouTube video. >> It probably depends on the platform, right, that you're optimizing for. Whereas like AI mode and AI overviews is going to heavily index on YouTube whereas >> could be a huge unlock. >> Could be. It has the potential, but it hasn't reached that point yet. >> Yeah. And the barrier to YouTube is

always so high like it just takes longer to make. >> I would say it's like weirdly underrated for B2B though cuz the consumer does video really well. But I'm like, "Oh, you you guys can just rip a bunch of videos on these questions like immediately going to, you know, pop into these citations." Um, what about review sites like G2 and

underrated underrated big arbitrage opportunity and the more niche the better? >> Yeah, >> sorry the my the plug is that go look at the AEO category in G2 and see who's number one right now. >> Um, what about like website performance? >> Oh, like speed, page speed. >> Yeah,

I would like my phrasing on that is like technical website like work I would say is also underrated. >> I was I was thinking about how to bucket that whether it was just technical website product management as a whole but then >> JavaScript is still not renderable. So

don't forget if you're rendering your stuff with JavaScript if your technical SEO implementation is kind of trashy >> technical now >> technical is a real thing.

domain >> navigation. Yeah, breadcrumbs. Those are all important, but that's just good for crawability anyway. >> Yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend anyone against it. I definitely would not be like you don't want more navigation rated rated rated. >> Um what about just let's say content owned content content marketing on-site

content? >> Uh probably probably rated to like underrated a little bit. >> Underrated. Yeah. Especially if you're a CEO who's like, I don't let my my team write X versus Y comparative list of goals. Like that stuff is so underrated. >> Super underrated. >> I think so too. Especially the startups too. It's like less red tape. Let's just

go. >> The only way I would say it's overrated is everyone knows to do it already. That's the only thing. But I don't think I think it still has tremendous power. It's like very rated. >> Um we're basically at time. Did I forget anything? Is there anything else you'd want to >> No.

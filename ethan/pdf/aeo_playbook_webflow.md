Introduction The evolution from search to answers AI is reshaping how
people discover, evaluate, and choose brands. A recent Forrester study
found that 95% of B2B buyers plan to use generative AI in their buying
process this year, underscoring just how quickly AI is transforming
customer behavior, especially when it comes to search. Instead of typing
short, keyword-driven queries, consumers now ask full questions ---
engaging in conversations that demand context, authority, and clear
answers. SEMrush projects that AI search will surpass traditional search
in just three years and Bain found that SEO traffic has dropped 15- 25%
across the board. And marketers have taken notice. In a recent Webflow
study, 93% of marketing leaders said that Answer Engine Optimization
(AEO) will be critical to their company's success in the next two years,
yet only 25% of marketing practitioners fully understand what AEO is,
illustrating a huge disconnect. The AEO playbook: How to optimize for

Introduction Where traditional SEO focuses on ranking for keywords, Why
it's AEO is about ensuring your brand delivers complete, credible, and
structured answers that AI can understand and surface. time to But that
puts new pressure on marketers to rethink their entire content and
search strategies while maintaining their make brand voice. With AI
interpreting your narrative and rephrasing it to answer the shift search
queries, brands risk being lost in a sea of sameness --- where
differentiation fades and narratives are diluted. That's why it's never
been more critical to actively own your brand's narrative and ensure the
work you've invested in differentiation is reflected in the AI summaries
and overviews that answer engines deliver. Without that effort, years of
brand-building risk being flattened into generic, interchangeable
responses --- or worse, distorted and misrepresented in ways that
undermine your brand's credibility. The potential upside for brands
taking early action is huge. On webflow.com, simply increasing the pace
of content refreshes drove 42% more traffic --- and 14% more signups ---
in under two months. This ebook provides an actionable framework to help
teams navigate the evolution from SEO to AEO. The four categories of our
AEO Maturity Model --- content, technical, authority, and measurement
--- each play a vital role in determining how your brand shows up in AI
search. In the following sections, you'll find detailed overviews of
each category and clear guidance to help your team move toward the
leading edge of AEO maturity. Building consistency across these
categories is what enables brands to strengthen visibility, protect
their narrative, and ensure they're represented accurately in AI-driven
discovery. The AEO playbook: How to optimize for AI-driven discovery 4

Introduction As AI answer engines redefine how brands are discovered, AT
A GLANCE marketers need a new framework for staying visible and
credible. Webflow's AEO Maturity Model was built to help teams The AEO
clearly assess their current standings and identify the steps required
to stay competitive in an AI-first search landscape. Maturity Grounded
in research on how large language models surface and summarize brand
information, the model organizes AEO Model progress across four key
categories --- content, technical, authority, and measurement --- each
representing a critical category of visibility in the age of AI. We
built it by combining insights from hundreds of CMO conversations, peer
SEO experts, and Webflow's own traffic data and aggregate anonymized
data across Webflow-hosted sites. After extensive research and testing
with industry leaders, we refined this framework to give marketing and
SEO teams a practical path for optimizing toward evolving AI standards.
Each category includes five levels of maturity, illustrating the
progression from traditional SEO practices to adaptive, AI-ready
optimization. Together, these categories and levels provide a shared
roadmap for teams to align, advance, and build long-term resilience in
how their brands are found and represented in the era of generative
search. "In conversations with hundreds of CMOs each quarter, one topic
consistently rises to the top: AEO. It represents both a challenge and
an opportunity for marketers --- reshaping how we build brands and drive
revenue. We created the AEO Maturity Model to give marketing leaders and
practitioners a clear, actionable framework to guide their teams and
measure progress. We're excited to keep learning alongside you as the
AEO landscape evolves." Guy Yalif Chief Evangelist at Webflow The AEO

01 \| Content Content Strong content is where every AEO strategy begins.
It's the material that provides genuinely useful answers to commonly
asked questions from throughout the buying journey. But traditional,
keyword-driven SEO where we simply target only search head terms isn't
enough anymore. Answer engines now expect comprehensive, structured, and
current information. That's why the content category matters: it ensures
your brand has something valuable to say --- and that answer engines
recognize it. Well-structured, regularly refreshed content (95% of
ChatGPT citations point to pages updated in the last 10 months) fuels
every other aspect of AEO. It not only drives discoverability, but also
reinforces authority and improves how your brand narrative is
represented across AI-powered search. Key takeaway from the content
category: Create content that earns trust by delivering complete,
credible answers --- structured for AI to understand and designed for
people to value. The AEO playbook: How to optimize for AI-driven

product pages, or Shift from counting keywords to answering real buyer
questions. about us sections. Content is typically created as one-off
pieces, with little connection to an ongoing narrative, and rarely
updated. Blogs and FAQs, which LLMs often favor for their digestible,
well-structured answers, are either missing or stale. At this level,
organic traffic is mostly driven by branded search, primarily capturing
people who already know you or are close to buying. Questions to ask:
For our top buyer questions, what related questions should we also be
answering? How are we planning content across the next two quarters to
ensure consistent storylines? As we scale, how do we make sure our voice
stays consistent and on-brand? How to get started: Identify the top 10

Organize your clusters under At level 3, content evolves from scattered
answers to a clear hierarchy to fully own structured clusters. Pages are
semantically rich, easy to read, entire topics. and designed in chunks
that AI engines can readily surface. At this stage, brands often
introduce a cornerstone piece of content --- such as an annual report,
original research study, or in-depth guide --- to anchor one of their
core topics. Competitor comparison pages begin to appear, and your
authority on certain topics becomes clearer. Questions to ask: Which
priority topic will we comprehensively own next? What will our annual
cornerstone piece of content be? Where can we add original insights or
data to differentiate from competitor content? How to get started: Map
one core topic across the funnel (awareness → consideration → purchase →
advocacy) Create a cornerstone anchor asset such as an annual report or
research study Create multi-level answers that comprehensively cover
related questions Refresh high-priority pages every 3-6 months, localize
content, and improve readability to Flesch 90+ The AEO playbook: How to

hierarchies to personalization. spanning the funnel from awareness
through advocacy. Each major topic is anchored by a cornerstone piece
and surrounded by supporting answers. Updates are consistent, content is
localized, and underperforming content is pruned. Questions to ask:
Which content assets do prospects most engage with and would benefit

# Page 17

02 \| Technical Technical While content is the foundation for creating
useful answers that resonate with both people and machines, it's not
enough on its own. Without a strong technical backbone, even the
best-crafted pages risk being invisible to answer engines. That's why
the technical category matters: it's the work that makes your content
easily discoverable by LLMs, strengthens your content and authority
efforts, and compounds the benefits of every other category. Important
tools like schema markup help crawlers and answer engines interpret
context and relationships more accurately. When implemented, schema
makes it far more likely that your content is surfaced accurately in AI
summaries and search overviews --- and when paired with structured
content, speed, strong security, and high availability, it ensures that
both humans and machines can access and trust your site experience. And
yet adoption is still low for some of the most impactful practices. For
example, while 73% of page-one results use schema markup, 88% of sites
don't use schema at all --- leaving a major opportunity for
forward-thinking brands. Key takeaway from the technical category: Build
a technical foundation that makes your content fast, accessible, and
easy for both people and AI systems to find and interpret. The AEO

search engines discover structure --- clear headings, new pages, while
indexing is what makes those pages visible bullet points, numbered
lists, in results. and FAQs --- so LLMs can interpret your content.
Without proper metadata, much of that effort is lost --- and there's
plenty of work to do. Research shows that 25% of top- ranking pages are
missing meta descriptions, one of the most fundamental SEO elements.
Level 1 is about getting the fundamentals right: on-page keyword
optimization, clean URL and site structure, few broken links, secure
pages that always resolve to HTTPS, optimized SEO metadata (title tags,
meta descriptions, header tags), and a working robots.txt. Questions to
ask: Where are our biggest SEO hygiene gaps? Which core or high-traffic
pages need attention for proper SEO hygiene and basic content structure?
Which pages should we prioritize for schema rollout? How to get started:

04 \| Measurement Measurement For the past 15 years, a key measure of
marketing success has been keyword rankings --- tracking where our
content appears among Google's blue links for the terms that matter
most. But in the world of LLMs, keyword rankings no longer apply. These
models don't surface direct excerpts from our sites; instead, they
reformulate our words into new paragraphs of their own. In the era of
AEO, measurement must evolve to answer the same core question through a
new lens: Are we showing up where our prospects are asking for us? AEO
measurement often starts by tracking whether your brand appears in the
answers to key questions. From there, it matures into measuring your
share of voice --- how often your brand appears compared to competitors
--- and the sentiment of those mentions. Unlike SEO, where Google used
our exact language, LLMs generate their own, making tone and context
essential indicators of brand strength. At the highest levels of
maturity, measurement becomes a rapid feedback loop that connects
directly to your content, technical, and authority efforts --- helping
your team make smarter, faster investment decisions. Key takeaway from
the measurement category: Build a measurement practice that connects
visibility, accuracy, and sentiment --- turning performance data into
continuous improvement across every pillar of AEO. The AEO playbook: How

LLMs our top buyer questions, do they mention or cite us? How to get

and tracks AI search results. when and how often your brand is mentioned
or cited. It's similar to how SEO tools like Semrush or Ahrefs regularly
query Google for your target keywords to monitor rankings. Today, there
are dozens of tools available that automate this process. Questions to
ask: How will we track and discuss brand mentions and sentiment in key
LLM answers during our regular meetings? How are we measuring conversion
rates, value, or behaviors from LLM-sourced traffic compared to other
channels --- especially unbranded SEO? How to get started: Use
third-party tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, Profound, Scrunch, or Graphite

analyze: • Inclusion: Is your brand included in the AI output? •
Citation: Are your owned resources linked? • Prominence: How early or
prominently does your brand appear? Systematically track conversion
rates (to the on-website actions you care about) for LLM-sourced and
non-LLM- sourced traffic. Bonus for tying this to revenue Begin
monitoring sentiment --- positive, neutral, or negative --- to
understand perception in AI-generated responses The AEO playbook: How to

04 \| Measurement How Webflow measures our own AEO efforts 8% Challenge
With the emergence of AI search as a new channel at of total new signups
Webflow, we needed to redefine our KPIs to measure the came directly
from LLms influence and actual business impact of AEO efforts, rather
than focusing on traditional SEO metrics. 24% Approach increase in
signups We shifted our measurement framework from tracking traffic
year-over-year and rankings to tracking influence, with different
success metrics across the funnel --- including visibility, citations,
share of voice, and conversions. We also focused on north star metrics
--- like LLM-attributed visits, signups, and new customers --- and
unified AI chatbot and non-brand SEO metrics into one holistic search
channel, to gain a more complete view of organic discovery performance.
For AI brand visibility tracking, we use an AEO measurement tool to
track both brand and non-brand queries across our top product categories
and different personas. This helps us understand where to prioritize our
AEO efforts. Impact We saw measurable business results from tracking and
understanding our AEO efforts, with 8% of total new signups coming
directly from LLMs. Overall, AI signups account for 42% of total
non-brand organic signups, and when combined with non-brand SEO, the
channel drove a total of +24% new signups year-over-year. The AEO

Turn your AEO insights into action AEO is still in its early days, but
its impact is already reshaping how brands are discovered and perceived.
As organic search declines and AI-driven answers dominate, marketing
teams face losing out on visibility, traffic, conversions, brand
dilution and misrepresentation if they fail to adapt. The narratives
that once lived on your own website are now being retold --- sometimes
inaccurately --- by large language models and answer engines. That's why
we built the AEO Maturity Model --- to help brands control their
visibility and voice. It gives teams a way to benchmark where they stand
across content, technical, authority, and measurement, while making it
easy to pinpoint gaps and turn progress into action. Like the early days
of SEO, this era will be defined by rapid innovation, new tools, and
evolving standards. And just as SEO became a core marketing discipline,
AEO will soon be essential for driving growth and shaping how audiences
discover and experience your brand. At Webflow, our goal is to keep
learning and leading alongside you --- sharing the latest research,
data, and best practices to help you stay current, confident, and
visible as AEO continues to evolve. Get your AEO assessment → The AEO

# From SEO to AEO: HubSpot’s New Growth Playbook

[music] Hey everybody, this is Danny Goodwin, editorial director of Search Engine Land. And uh today I'm being joined by Asia Frost. Uh we have an interesting discussion I think coming up about GEO, AEO, AI, and all the all the all the good hot topics. Uh and it's great to meet you, Asia, because I've actually never run into you on the conferences or

anywhere. So it's really nice to connect with you. You know, Danny, I was going to say it's nice to see you, which is my go-to if I'm not sure whether I've seen someone or met someone before. I figured we had met because we definitely run in the same circles, but I'm delighted to be finally officially making uh your acquaintance. >> Absolutely. So, uh I figured before we

dive in, uh for the people watching or listening, uh do you want to introduce yourself? Tell us a little bit about who you are and what you do. >> Yep. I am senior director of global growth and paid media at HubSpot. Global growth is uh our catchall for top offunnel non-paid demand which largely translates to SEO and now AEO and I've been at HubSpot for a little over nine

years which is about eight years longer than I thought I would be. Um for those who don't know then HubSpot is the customer platform that powers 268,000 teams. Uh and it changes I would say as a company every few years which is what has kept me there. I think we have had a really interesting journey to this point and we are embarking on what I believe is the most interesting era of SEO AO

and and really marketing yet. Absolutely. So, yeah, it is a a very fun time and you know, you've obviously been around for a few years at this point. So, very curious to get your take. Uh, you know, I was actually so uh we had advanced a while back our our conference returned in person and at that point in time I'm like, oh, this whole AEO versus GEO versus whatever

we're going to call it debate, it's got to be settled by the time like October, November comes around. And I'm surprised that it has not still been settled. So I'm curious from your perspective uh where do you stand on that whole name debate what are you calling it you know this new form of SEO or if it's some even if you consider it a new form of SEO you know there's been GEO AEO some

people call it AI SEO what are you kind of calling this practice right now internally and and why have you settled on whatever term that is >> yeah great question because this was the topic of much debate internally at HubSpot I think we debated all of the names that you just mentioned and probably 10 more. And we ultimately landed on AEO or answer engine

optimization because we think it best reflects how people are using AI and what businesses, brands should be doing in response. So I think SEO you wanted to rank in the results like that was pretty clear. Now you want to be a part of the answer. And so answer engine optimization is the tactics, the plays that you run to show up as part of that answer. Also, it just sounds cooler than

GEO in my opinion. But we'll see how long the debate rages on. Uh I have learned not to underestimate how long people in our particular world can spend haggling and debating this type of thing. >> Yes, I know. It's it's sort of like subdomains versus subfolders. If you've been around long enough, you'll know what that means [laughter] and how long

that debate has been going on. And I can't even tell you. Uh more than a decade, I'm I'm safe in assuming. Um so yeah. Um obviously this is a big whatever we call it ultimately or whatever it gets decided it is called. This this does feel like a big transition point for search, you know, from traditional ranking search to AI search was more about retrieval. So for

you, how how has it changed the way you you're thinking about visibility and strategy? >> Yeah, we are very much thinking about AEO as an evolution of SEO, which I did my homework and I'm just a Danny Goodwin fan, so I know that I think we're on the same page there. Um, and yes, that was an intentional pun. I think one thing that has actually

always been a very hub philosophy is do what's best for the customer and that's always overlapped really neatly with our SEO strategy. It's also what Google has preached for many years. Do what's best for the customer. You may miss out on some short-term wins, but in the long run your site is going to perform better. And that is at the heart of our AEO strategy. I also think that the

three uh buckets of plays that we're running are familiar from SEO. So the what hasn't changed, but the how has. And I'll go a click deeper there. Those three buckets for us are content, technical, and offsite. Our content for AEO looks fairly different than it does for SEO. It's much more specific. It's much nicher and deeper. It's structured differently. It's written differently,

but it's always intended to be what's best for the customer or best for the reader. The second bucket is technical. And again, I think that Google indexes ingests content differently than AI bots do. And so we need to adjust our technical strategies to match while not doing anything that's harmful for Googlebot because of course we still care about Google. And then offsite, one

thing that is probably the clearest from SEO to AEO is the emphasis on brand mentions rather than links. And so we're really shifting our off-site strategy to be much more about positive mentions in the places that AI is training and citing versus getting back links on high domain authority websites. >> Yeah. Yeah. that that is a big shift I think still a lot of people aren't uh

ready for you know because it's been again like so much of the stuff the tactics have been ingrained for and I forget how long have you been doing SEO roughly >> I've been doing SEO for a little over a decade >> yeah about over a decade so of course SEO is probably about near 30 years old at this point so

>> Oh J we didn't say we're gonna talk about my age on the podcast >> hey [laughter] but yeah Um, sorry about that. [laughter] >> No, we're all good. You know, >> so yeah, I mean it's just like there's this kind of this whole playbook I think that a lot of people are attached to and you know change is scary for a lot of

people. So I think this has been you know kind of rethinking that stuff is important because nothing is static and especially right now things are just kind of chaotic like the the amount of changes we're seeing it's it's crazy. So >> yeah, >> change is so scary. I think change is scary for us. We also had the pressure of not just figuring this out for our

own internal strategy but for figuring it out for our customers. The strategy that we are shipping right now. I have a very direct line to uh our VP of product for our marketing hub. Uh I also spend a lot of time with the the head of product for content hub. Um, those two products basically represent your website and content strategy in HubSpot. And everything that we're doing, I'm telling

them about the stuff that's working, the stuff that's not working, so they can turn that into product learnings as quickly as possible. Um, and I think it is terrifying and exhilarating and exciting all at once. >> Yeah. And with that change, I think there's a lot of rethinking about how we define success, right? So a AEO is not going to be the same success metrics

that we had with SEO. >> So how are you actually thinking about that right now? Because you know again it used to be like how many links can I acquire? But what are you thinking about now? Is it like what's important? Is it visibility in AI answers? You know getting citations or mentions? Is it the actual conversions from the traffic which again is not as large as traffic

from search? But um there there is debate over whether it's higher quality at this point which maybe we'll get into a little bit later. >> Yeah. How are you sort of defining su success with AEO? >> This was also a topic of much debate and we actually published the results on our loop marketing page. We have a new scorecard for how companies should be

thinking about marketing in the age of AI and AEO which fits into uh this loop marketing framework has a few new northstar metrics. The first and the one that I would argue is the most important is visibility. And it's visibility and not traffic or not citations because visibility is what's going to ultimately inform whether someone converts and they might not convert in that session.

They're probably not going to convert directly from their interaction with the LLM. We know that LLMs just are really bad at navigational search and so they're probably opening up a new tab or maybe two days later, 5 days later going to the website. the the visibility is what informs what we care about which is the conversion. So that's number one. That takes by the way a lot of education

with your exec leadership and I am very lucky to work at a company uh whose leadership is deeply embedded in all these conversations and I think gets it. But if you are at a company where your CEO is not reading search engine land, it's definitely worth doing a deep dive to help them understand why visibility is the number one. Second is share voice. So what is your

visibility like relative to your competitors? And I think that's a really useful benchmark. I know that there was a lot of coverage back in midepptember when uh Chad GBT really turned down the dial on visibility for brands. And if you were just looking at visibility, you might think, "Oh, something's going haywire with my strategy. If you look at share voice and share voice is constant

or growing, you know that you're doing the right thing." Uh agnostic of some of the algorithmic changes. Then we get to mentions or sorry, mentions goes into visibility. Then we get to citations. Uh, how many times is your website used as a source in answer engine responses? And I think this is really important. I think a lot of brands go after

citations first. I'm putting it third on our list. I think it is important because if you get the citation, what we have found is your average ranking in the response and the sentiment of that description, they're both better, which makes a ton of sense. If you control the source, you're always going to say the nicest things about yourself and put yourself first. Um, if you overindex on

citations, however, you're going to miss out on a wide swath of visibility that I think is like pretty critical. >> Interesting. Very cool. Um, so in what ways, uh, you know, you've done a lot of experimenting, which I want to get into a minute, uh, with optimizing for LLMs and answers, AI generated answers. what ways do you see SEO and AEO being similar and then maybe where do you see

them sort of separating a little bit? >> Yeah, I think this goes back to what I was talking about uh solving for the customer or doing what what is good for the end user. I think that is shared for SEO and AO. And one of the questions you probably get because I get it all the time is well if I do this for AO will it be bad for SEO? And my answer is always no. If you are doing if you were rolling

out an AO strategy that is good for the end user. So an example of what would be bad for the end user would be burying secret instructions in content for an AI agent. A good thing would be creating really helpful specific content that's going to answer a really niche query that someone is asking chatbt. And as long as you are solving for that end user, I think that both um you'll

benefit in both disciplines. You you'll benefit in answer engines as well as Google. And then I think the three um higher level categories of plays are similar. But where I think things get very different are again the content is just we're going from these very broad highlevel topics these ultimate guides which HubSpot

this is a I don't know a dubious claim to fame but when I started in SEO and HubSpot [clears throat] then I was telling the blog team what keywords I thought we should target and and recommending search friendly titles and I was I really liked ultimate guide. I just thought it sounded nice. So, every title I recommended was ultimate guide this, ultimate guide that. And then, of

course, a lot of websites started using ultimate guide. And now I'll click through the serves and I see ultimate guide everywhere. And I'm like, >> I think this is my vault. [laughter] Um, so you're going from the ultimate guide to, you know, this is the exact use case that this exact persona wants to accomplish and here's how to do it and here's some original data that we've

gotten from customers just like you. And if you come from an answer engine, it's going to be tailored exactly to what we know about you. And so it's a very different style of content and um content journey. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Because I I feel like and I've I had this conversation not, you know, not publicly, but there

were conversations after the whole brewhaha about all the traffic HubSpot lost when that that came out on I don't even remember what month that was this year. earlier probably in the spring and just how much traffic they were losing. Everyone everybody was losing their minds over it and I was like wow you know you kind of forget the influence that HubSpot had on content marketing as

a whole. Like you your playbook that you guys came up with was used by so many other websites like it just you know repurposed for their specific topic or niche or niche or whatever. But yeah, like HubSpot that playbook uh was huge for a lot of years, right? I think that's that was started like right before COVID or around that time and then just sort of exploded.

>> Well, is that is that the right time frame? I think >> Yeah, I think it depends on what you're talking about. If you're talking about inbound, inbound, I think, is really at the heart of the web. um at least for a lot of companies that were publishing educational content and goes >> way way back. Um and then yeah, I think we have always been very much a build in

public company and and we we share our successes and our strategies along the way, which is what we're doing right now with Loop Marketing. Um and I think that has led to a lot of companies saying, "Oh, this was really successful for HubSpot. I'm going to adopt it as well." Which is good. that's what we wanted. Um, but I also think that when we started seeing declines from the

emergence of AIOS and the changing nature of Google, that was a bit of a bell weather for what I think a lot of websites are now seeing. And so, one, I think, response could have been, oh, we're not going to build in public anymore. We're going to be very cy about what we're doing and what's working so that doesn't happen again. But that's obviously not what we're doing. We're

trying to be even more transparent and helpful. Um, and I really hope and believe that loot marketing, which is uh not a replacement of inbound, but meant to be again an extension of and and a really helpful framework for companies can can play that role. >> Okay. So, yeah. So, just going back to that that traffic drop, uh I I was basically told it was about an 80%

traffic drop and you kind of helped the company through that and now in LLM world, uh HubSpot is the most cited CRM. Is that correct? >> Or the most visible CRM in >> most visible. Okay, gotcha. All right. And and obviously this is again this is a fairly new technology. So um when you were starting to approach this um optimization on LLMs and AEO, how did

you start that journey? Like what were the first few things that you maybe either thought about or tried uh that did or did not work? >> Yeah. Well, the first thing I did that I would really recommend folks do if they don't have an AEO function already stood up was I um pulled together some of the IC's on our team that were already doing a lot of experimentation and research in

their own time. And as like in my day-to-day, I'm usually working with managers or directors. I'm not super close to the work, but I knew that I needed to be really close to this and and really help guide it. And so I said, we're going to meet the the three of us. Um we're going to meet once a day. We are going to launch one experiment per week if we can. We are I I'm working

with the dev team so that whatever we need to do, we can execute as quickly as possible. And so we took a very experimental mindset from the get-go. And what we started out with was how do we scale good quality datari content. We had been thinking and I think most people thought about content you know maybe in a month you put out 30 pieces. If you're super if you're like a news

publication you could be putting out hundreds. But we're thinking in multipliers of tens most teams. And I think we need to be thinking in multipliers of hundreds or thousands. And so with the team, I wanted to figure out, okay, how do we create that content? How do we start relatively small? So like batches of 10 generated with AI reviewed by a human and then how

do we scale that over time? >> That I think has been very successful. We're still experimenting with the types of content that get the most um visibility in answer. And so that's what a lot of experimentation revolves around. We also did a lot of what I think of as good clean AEO. Uh so making sure that we were using all the available schema

types across our website. Um making sure that things were really well structured and that we're leading with the answer. and each section of the page is semantically complete and things are formatted in a Q&A format. You know, a lot of things that I think are now becoming like the standard AEO playbook. >> So, you mentioned content types. I was just curious because I know there's been

a lot of noise about how some people are abusing top, you know, top X lists, you know, the top the top 10 best whatever insert thing here. Um, is that the sort of stuff you you you've been playing around with or is there some sort of when you say content formats, I was curious what you if there's anything you can share about what you found that works maybe better.

>> Yeah. So, I'm not thinking so much about top X for Y, although I think that that still very much has a place in people's content playbooks. But what we're really experimenting with is Danny, what's the last thing you uh did research with Chachev Tea to buy? >> Oh, to buy. Uh, it's pro it's probably researching to like go to a find a hotel for Christmas.

>> Okay. Find a hotel for Christmas. So the context that Chadvt is going to have when it recommends a hotel for you is probably about how much money you typically spend based on some demographic data it's collected about you. If you've done any hotel research in the past, where you're going, obviously how long you're going to stay, hotels in the area.

>> We want to provide the answers for all of those contextual clues. So, if I were a hotel and I was trying to show up in answer engines, I would be creating content that spoke to your particular persona type and your particular use case. Now, I think the challenge is doing that without that content being duplicative or spammy. And to do that, this is what we spent spend a lot of

time on. What are all the data sources that we can ingest to feed these systems essentially so that all the content is unique? It's grounded in what we know the persona needs and it's not repetitive from page to page. >> Awesome. Um, so as you've gone through this process, were there any maybe big surprises like, "Oh my god, I didn't think that would work." Or is there just

like any kind of aha moments um as you've been doing all this optimization for AI answers? >> The hardest part has been the measurement. Uh I think that we are still very much as an industry and I know this because I talked to a lot of AO vendors figuring out how to correlate the actions that we are taking with specific visibility increases and it's

highly dependent on the prompts you're tracking. Um, and and I think that that that leaves the room for uncertainty and ambiguity because what if you're tracking the wrong prompts or what if you're tracking the right prompts but not enough of them? Um, there are just many it's far less clear to say I did X and Y happened than it was with SEO. And even with SEO, you know, we couldn't run

AB tests. We were always doing look backs. There's so many variables at play. Um so I think that's I talked about education with um execs around why visibility is the most important. I think the other really important piece of education not just for executive leadership but for um you know SEO AEO teams is getting comfortable with less data and fewer direct lines between what

we're doing and the results. So that's been I don't know if that's been surprising because I I think I knew going in that that was going to be hard but as we've progressed and we've done more and more teasing apart the impact of individual experiments has gotten harder and harder. >> Gotcha. Um so I heard uh through just on background of you know getting this

interview set up that you sort of have a formula for getting chat GBT to recommend a brand. So I wanted to hear all about that. What can you tell us about that? Hm. Well, I think that many of the best tactics that we use are successfully using uh are ones that I've already mentioned throughout the article. So, we've spent a lot of time talking about hypersp specific

personacentric content. Uh what we've talked about a little less is the off-site tactics that we're using. And what we've done is identified uh ChowBT and Google because those are our priority engines. We've identified their top training and citation sources and then we have put together a concerted strategy to show up as positively and frequently as possible in those places.

Um, and two big areas for us have been YouTube and Reddit, which probably won't surprise anyone as as being very influential for answer engine. >> Uh, I can go a little bit more into some of the things we've done there if that's useful. >> Yeah, I think so because, you know, obviously there's been some research done around how heavily cited Reddit and

YouTube and a few other sites are. So, yeah, I'd be kind of curious to know like from a strategic standpoint maybe like how how you guys are approaching Reddit and YouTube. Yeah, very different strategies for each and and one big learning for us, I wouldn't say this is in the last year because we've been very active on both platforms for several years, but um treating every social

media platform as its own beast and really getting to know the lay of the land and understanding the culture and the rules and the unspoken rules before we engage. I mean, that's just a general best practice for any community or or social media site. But on YouTube, uh, we have a large slate of owned channels from marketing against the grain and HubSpot marketing, uh, to, um, I'm

trying to think, how to HubSpot, science of scaling. It really runs the gamut. And we the uh global growth or SEO AO team works really closely with the teams creating those con that content to a um weave in organic mentions of the products where they make sense and make sure that we are creating content on topics that we know answer engines and people care about. We also have a lot of

creator partnerships with folks who speak to our relevant audience and somewhat similar playbook there. We want organic relevant uh contextual mentions of HubSpot. >> So that's like influencer marketings that sort of thing when you say creator. >> Yeah. Yeah. I think you could call it influencer marketing. Yeah. I mean we we sign um multimonth sometimes one year

contracts with creators and and say you know we will pay you XYZ and and in exchange you will create content on these wide topics. Well, we give them a lot of editorial freedom, but you know, you will mention HubSpot in X videos, that sort of thing. >> Gotcha. >> Uh, and then on Reddit, it is a much more

um advocacy and community centric approach. And I should have shouted out HubSpot Media. Um, on the YouTube front, they are a fantastic partner to my team. On the, uh, Reddit front, we work really closely with HubSpot community. um another internal team and in the last year we became the co-odderator of HubSpot's subreddit and we have spent most of our time

making that subreddit as productive and uh engaging as possible because what we've seen which is really interesting is that the more activity that happens in our HubSpot the more positive mentions of HubSpot there are across Reddit Because basically you're creating a team of advocates who are really excited about your brand, your product, and then they organically go out into

conversations on our sales, our marketing, our CRM, and they say good things about HubSpot. So, um, very, very different strategies, but both focused on, uh, getting the right people to say nice things about HubSpot. >> Awesome. So, I was I was kind of curious. I think we touched on this a little bit earlier. um you know Google search versus traffic you get

from AI engines it's very different you know it's not as large uh we've actually reported uh in the last couple months uh three different stories basically saying that um you know traffic that you get from LLMs is either worse or about on par with Google search in terms of converting. Uh I'm curious what you're what you've seen there like are do you see that to be the case or do you see

like quality traffic coming through? >> Yeah, the traffic that directly comes from LLMs converts at about three times better than traditional search for us. >> Uh so we are definitely seeing higher conversion rates and I I've read the SEL uh stories. I was looking at I think the one you most recently published which was like 900 ecom websites over the course of a year. Yeah, I I I shared

that with my team last week. Um I was curious whether the difference in conversion rates had anything to do with the difference in um the type of product and the buying journey. Like I think by the time someone is coming to hubspot.com from an LLM, you know, they've done some they've done a lot of research. At least that's what our analysis suggests. And so they're much

readier to convert than someone who might in the old world have been coming to the blog to download an ebook on content marketing. >> Yep. Yeah. >> Um but yeah, it's been another really fascinating area to watch the industry debate. uh because I I've also seen several different uh different stats >> right and it's very you know again it's

very early and these are not largecale studies it's just sort of anecdotal I guess we would say but it's you know any data I I think is useful because at least it gets people thinking about all of these things and it's going to always go back to it depends like it may be different for ecom versus you know B2B or whatever the case may be so >> um I I think there's still a lot that's

going to change and where AI is now. Like, you know, I've I even today was seeing somebody saying like, "We're at peak AI already." I'm like, "Really?" [laughter] Like, it's >> it's two years old. Like, come on. >> Yeah. I uh I would disagree with that. I think there are, to your point, >> some things that could be step function increases in conversion rates. Uh

obviously, instant checkout, that's huge. I think that this was obviously over the course of a year and I do remember seeing in the study that um >> conversion rates had increased over time maybe as people got more comfortable or familiar with chatbt but instant checkout's huge I don't know what adoption for Atlas is going to be or for any of these AI browsers to be fair but

agent mode or agentic uh you know checkout would definitely improve conversion rates so I think we're at the very early innings of this. >> So, I'm curious, you know, this is sort of a forward-looking thing, you know, it's just kind of predictive. I'm just kind of curious, where do you think AEO as a practice will be at maybe a year from now? Do you think it'll be kind of

its own thing? Do you think it'll be part of SEO? And is there anything that you maybe kind of excited to see happen from ChatBT or some of these other engines that could make uh make these systems even better? Um, I think a lot hinges on when Google makes AI mode more of the primary search experience. >> Yep.

>> I don't believe that you are going to get an AI powered answer for every search. >> My belief is for navigational queries at the very least you're probably always going to have something that feels like the traditional SER and that it gets you from point A to point B very quickly. But I think for a lot if not most other searches you will probably be in some

form of AI mode. And at that point SEO and AO become merged because there is no real traditional SER to optimize for anymore. >> Yep. Exactly. That's that's sort of been my problem with this whole naming debate. If you're going to call it AI SEO, what happens if that search engine goes away? There's no more there's no more SE and SEO. So

>> totally. Yeah. And also that doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. Like I don't want to stand up in say I'm an AI SEO, >> right? Exactly. So um okay, so I guess my final question for you, uh this has been a great conversation. I could probably talk to you for a lot longer, but um if if you could maybe give people one AEO type of experiment you think

maybe they could run before the end of the year, you know, to kind of get a feel for it or just anything that you think might be helpful for them to kind of experiment with. Is there anything maybe you could suggest to people like try this tactic or this strategy or whatever? I think if you want a real project then I would try creating those hypersp

specific very persona focused pages. I think if you're looking for something that you could run with and get live by the end of the week use one of the many query fanout tools that are available online. See take a page uh that's already exists on your website. plug like a a likely reasonable query that would lead someone to that page into a query fan out pool

and then assess whether your page answers or has content for all of the sub queries that that pool provides and if it doesn't add them and then see does your visibility for that head question increase. >> Awesome. Any final thoughts? anything we didn't talk about that you'd love to comment on or leave people with some parting, you know, parting words of

wisdom? >> Yeah, I would I would be remiss not to direct people to hubspot.com/loopmarketing. Uh we have spent a lot of time on AO. Of course, AAO is uh one of the tactics in this new growth framework for the AI era, but there's a lot more that we believe businesses can and should be doing to not just survive, but thrive.

Um, and so, yeah, hubs.com/loopmarketing, check it out. I think there's a lot there. >> Awesome. And just just for anyone who's listening and doesn't know, what is Loop Marketing? like can you give us just a quick overview of what that is because you mentioned a couple times. >> Yeah, L marketing is a growth framework

for businesses. Uh there are four phases. There is express, tailor, amplify and evolve. And each of those four phases has a host of plays and tactics. But the general idea is that as the web changes, as folks go from progressing through this ever narrowing funnel to getting an answer in an LLM, then going to your Instagram, then reading a review and and really having

like a much more messy, much less linear journey. We need a new framework for marketing. And so this framework is an ever evolving, much more flexible, dynamic framework. >> Right? Right. So, it's sort of like that old bendy straw, the messy middle as Google put it, I think. Right. >> Yes. Yes. I will say messy middle came up many times in our conversations

around the loop. Yeah. >> Awesome. All right. Well, that is all the time I have for you for today. It was a great conversation. Really appreciate you taking the time to chat with us and uh yeah, look forward to seeing more from you in the future and wishing you nothing but success heading forward. >> Thanks so much, Danny. This is really

fun. >> All right. Thanks, Asia. Bye everybody.

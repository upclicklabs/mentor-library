# 5 BRAND NEW Digital Marketing Strategies for 2025

digital marketing is changing in 2025 because of a once inag generation shift in how people respond to advertising big brands have already moved to these brand new marketing strategies for 2025 here's how small businesses like yours can steal them to win big in this video I'm going to show you the five most explosive new strategies for 2025 how you can use AI the right way to

supercharge your marketing and I'll even show you the secret to create creting a completely free start to finish marketing plan customized just for your business but before we can look at what's new we need to understand exactly what's changed so over the past year we've been seeing customers aren't following that same straightforward path from seeing an ad all the way to making

a purchase instead they're hopping between different platforms interacting with content in ways that feel more natural to them and this shift is is being driven by a new type of consumer one that doesn't think or act like older Generations I'm talking about gen Z younger buyers are just skeptical of traditional advertising and they prefer more authentic content whether it's from

influencers creators or other users but what if your business doesn't really sell to gen Z so while it's true they are leading the shift it's something that's affecting all generations even your target market that's because younger groups often set the trends that then the older ones eventually follow so even if Jen Z is not your target audience right now this shift is going

to impact how everyone engages with your business that's why in 2025 organic marketing is on the rise so instead of throwing money at ads that people are just going to skip or block smart brands are starting to shift their focus to content that actually feels real like social media media posts educational videos and influencer Partnerships and organic marketing has a really good

long-term value because it doesn't stop working when you stop spending right it builds trust and credibility over time and in today's world that's exactly what your audience cares about one of the best ways to build that kind of trust fast is through video but for most small businesses creating video content just sounds like it's all too much you know video can help you reach audience but

the pressure to make it entertaining and then editing it can be overwhelming especially when you're already stretched thin editing takes time and trying to compete with polished high production content just isn't realistic when you've got a business to run the good news is you don't need flashy editing or jokes or Graphics to succeed on YouTube what really works is just simple educational

videos that focus on providing real value you know entrepreneurs like Alex heroi are proving that minimal editing and just really straightforward content can be really effective Alex actually recently made the shift to No Frills just purely educational videos because what matters most is the information itself he actually found that his more entertaining highly edited and

fast-paced videos they just attracted the wrong audience they were there to be passively entertained but they they didn't really mean business but then when he switched over to videos like these you know no frills no Graphics just plain old teaching he got way more people who were actually interested in working with him so he gets to save time and make more money it's a win-win right

and for small business owners like you this new strategy takes a lot of the pressure off you don't need to spend hours editing or worrying about if it's funny or entertaining enough the real key is just delivering valuable information that helps your audience focus on what you know best and present it in a clear conversational way just the way you'd explain things to a

customer in person as long as your sound quality is good and your content's genuinely helpful there's no need for fancy visuals or effects this approach not only builds trust but it also shows your audience that you're the go-to expert in your field without having all those extra production headaches if you're looking for a way to grow your influence and build a more professional

audience especially if you're more of a B2B business LinkedIn newsletters are one of the most powerful tools available right now so what sets them apart from other content sharing methods like regular LinkedIn posts or blogs is their incredible reach and staying power first newsletters on LinkedIn go Way Beyond just your connections unlike you know a typical post that just quickly Fades

from the feed after 24 hours newsletter get directly sent to your subscribers inboxes and they stay there that means your content isn't buried in their feed it lands right in front of them and here's the cool part your audience isn't just limited to your LinkedIn followers take John Hall for example he has under 70,000 followers right now but his newsletter reaches over 330,000

subscribers that's the kind of visibility we're talking about on top of that LinkedIn doubles your exposure by posting your newsletter to your feed and sending it to your subscribers emails so you're getting more eyeballs in your content without needing to do twice the work plus every new subscriber to your newsletter automatically becomes one of your followers too helping you grow your

LinkedIn community effortlessly and another major advantage is that LinkedIn provides a built-in audience of professionals unlike starting a newsletter from scratch on your own website where it's just going to be a constant battle to build up subscribers LinkedIn makes it really easy to tap into its own huge Network plus being on LinkedIn gives your content a

professional credibility that's really going to be hard to match with a personal blog in 2025 growing your email list is still one of the most powerful ways to grow your business I just launched a brand new course a few months back and I made six figures in a week only launching to my email list of around 30,000 people so if you think email marketing is outdated I

wholeheartedly disagree what's outdated isn't email marketing itself it's just how most businesses go about collecting those emails in 2025 the single most powerful way of building your email list is by offering custom gpts as lead magnets imagine being able to offer potential clients their own personal AI assistant that can help them solve specific problems related to your

service you're basically creating a second version of yourself that's available 24/7 so you can provide real value up front and exchange you get their email now in case you're confused I know examples help so a financial adviser could train a custom GPT that provides personalized budgeting tips investment strategies and retirement planning advice a personal trainer could

offer a GPT that generates custom workout ideas based on their own fitness goals and their preferred equipment and for a dog trainer the GPT might give some custom advice for those common dog behavioral issues it's basically like giving your prospects a sneak peek of all your best expertise and then once they see the value you bring with your advice they're much more likely to reach

out for a full consultation now this genius strategy for getting a fully customized marketing plan that's coming right up in a second but first let's talk about AI powered chatbots and how they're becoming a musthave for businesses in 2025 these tools don't just handle basic FAQs anymore they're way more powerful than you know so they can create a legit personalized realtime

experience for your visitors 24/7 that actually results in more money in your pocket think about it right most people today expect to find a quick direct way to communicate with a business that they want to work with and a chatbot is by far and away the simplest way to make that happen in fact people are way more willing to talk to a chat feature way before they'll even

consider you know picking up the phone or firing off an email and since chat tools shorten the sales cycle by giving people those immediate answers they're not only convenient for them they're really strategic for you I actually use AI chatbots on the sales Pages for my courses they're trained by me to answer FAQs yes but more importantly to figure out who's the right fit for my programs

cuz because you know people visiting those pages often have the one big question is this course right for me my chatbot just asks all the right questions to figure that out and it helps guide them through the decision-making process giving them a lot of clarity on whether the program is tailored to where they are and what they need right now plus customers who

message your business expect to be answered within 60 seconds right meeting that expectation without AI would mean either paying someone who's truly skilled in your business not cheap or interrupting your own productivity to respond yourself the AI chatbot then is like having a full-time team member minus the cost and as it interacts with your customers more and more you can

make it smarter you know fine-tuning its responses and just learning how to serve your customers better all right so far we've covered strategies that work for pretty much any service business but here's the thing your business is unique and your goals aren't one siiz fits all that's where this next strategy really stands out using chat gpt's new 01 model to create a oneclick fully customized

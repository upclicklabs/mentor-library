# World's No 1 LinkedIn Expert: How To Grow a Personal Brand FAST in 2026

If you're looking to blow up, grow a massive brand, and this is something that people don't do enough. And if you do this in a very like specific and focused way, instantly you're just getting like hundreds of thousands of followers. Wow. >> Algorithm as it is right now is really focused on likes, views, not that important. That post drove between like

8 to 10,000 followers. >> Wow. >> Just from one post. >> That's Josh Sanders, head of content for Chris Donnelly, one of the fastest growing LinkedIn pages and personal brands in the world. We've had some insane insane results. We'd have some days genuinely where we'd do like 50,000 followers in like one day.

>> That's insane. >> In this episode, Josh reveals how he grew Chris's pages to over 3 million followers on LinkedIn. >> Find the reason to why you want to post on LinkedIn. Always respond to your audience. Optimizing your profile page. The easiest way to convert someone into a follower is >> how they converted that audience to a

$10 million a year education business and how you can too. We were driving thousands of people simply by just having two subscribers like that. >> That's crazy. >> It sounds so obvious. I'm not sure how many people know about it, but you can >> and how they use newsletters to compound their growth and build trust. >> The most powerful thing we found is

>> that is so interesting. >> It was generally at the point where we grew so quickly in in newsletter subs, but the founder of Kit, Nathan Barry, was like, he messaged us and was like, "What are you guys doing?" I've never seen anything like this. I've never seen organic growth like this. This is an absolute content masterass. I really hope you enjoy it. Let's dive in.

>> Josh, thanks so much for doing this. >> Thanks for having me. It's great to be here. >> You have made almost $10 million from LinkedIn in the last 18 months working with Chris Donnelly. And you've grown his pages to over 3 million followers. >> Yes. Yeah. >> I would like to make $10 million a year from from LinkedIn. I'd like to have 3

million followers. So, I'm sure there's loads of people in our audience who are watching this and listening to this who would like to do the same. So, if you're down for it, I would love for you to talk us through step by step how we can replicate some of your success. Would you be up for that? >> Yeah, absolutely. I'm so down to get into this.

>> LinkedIn, it's this incredible platform. There's like a billion users. >> Yes. >> And something crazy like only 1% of them are actually posting. >> Yes, you're correct. Yeah. If I'm looking at this platform and I'm looking at growing my business from it, >> what would be like the first place to start? Is it the content? Is it some

other place? What what do you what do you say to people? >> So the first thing that we say to everyone is find the reason to why you want to post on LinkedIn in the first place like the overall why basically because a lot of people will start with quite an unclear vision and they'll post for the sake of it and that basically just means that you're going to have

like confusion with your content down the line. So if you have like a very very clear why and like a reason and a purpose for doing it that basically just means that you can reverse engineer it from that why and you can break down like your clear content pillars you can break down you know all the different types of formats that you want to do and all drive them towards that first why

basically. >> Yeah. And so I guess with with Chris what would have that have been? It was like he had a business or he just wanted to build his personal brand or what was what was kind of the thinking there? So with Chris, it was quite uh an ambitious mission which is I think something that really attracted me. He essentially just wanted to become like the most

well-known business creator entrepreneur uh on the planet which is obviously a massive goal with you know Hozi and Cody Sanchez and people like that but that was the mission and so we started off with LinkedIn. When I joined he had about 180,000 followers at that time I think he had very little following on on the video platforms. I think he had like 5 to maybe 10,000 on like Tik Tok. Mhm.

>> He had an Instagram but I think the positioning he didn't feel like quite comfortable with. So we basically restarted that from scratch when I started working with him because he had the large audience on LinkedIn already. That was a platform that we were like okay got the main focus on this. It was also something that throughout his businesses he had like benefits from

using like it attracted a large amount of the clients that came in to his first agency Verb. And so we were just like okay this platform is really great. There's way less competition on there already. uh if we like really like go in all in on this, it'll mean that we hopefully should uh benefit and and get some advantage that you wouldn't necessarily get on other platforms

basically. >> Yeah. Yeah, cuz it feels like LinkedIn is probably the most slept on platform, almost like the easiest to create on as well because it it's kind of written posts and I know there are carousels and there's video on there, but it still feels like anyone could get up LinkedIn and type whereas the barrier to entry on Instagram, YouTube just feels a lot more

intense. It kind of feels like the easiest to create on. >> And then to your point around the value there, people are on there to do business. >> Yes. They're they're on Instagram, Tik Tok, YouTube to probably be entertained. Yeah. >> And relax and have a bit of fun. Whereas on LinkedIn, you are literally there to

do business or to waste some time when you're at work. But it looks like you're working. >> Yes. >> And I remember Chris had won a client. Was it like Bugatti for his previous a for his agency business from LinkedIn from a LinkedIn post? You've got those decision makers at all those companies there. It feels like the place where if

you want to grow your business and win business like that's the platform to go on >> 100% >> and perversely almost like the easiest one. So first of all let's say I've set my goal is build my personal brand because I think good things happen when I do that. Opportunities come my way >> and then I guess for me it would be grow

my podcast agency. >> Sure. >> Um and my content services business. >> Okay. >> That that would probably be like my goal there. >> Okay. You said something about content pillars and like yes starting to think about how what type of content I create. >> Yeah, absolutely. So okay, so if the

goal for you would be to grow your uh podcast agency, >> I would think okay, what sort of pillars can we break down uh into that? And it's actually interesting. So when we say content pillars, >> the traditional approach is like three to five things that like relate to you or your business that you know are very specific, very focused, have a very

targeted audience. Um we actually break it down a different way. We have what we call interest pillars, which are topics that will relate into your business but have a much broader appeal. For example, with with your guys with the podcast stuff, maybe it's something to do with, I don't know, like video in general or like the creator economy. It's something a little bit broader. It's not

necessarily directly linked in with you guys, but it's something that can reach a much larger market. >> Yeah. It's like like general marketing, brand marketing, cool things brands are doing. >> Yes. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Marketing would be a good one as well. like just a general marketing sort of strategy. So you have the interest pillars which are

those that are much broader and then you have the more expert pillars. So these are things a little bit more specific to you a lot more focused on like one or two key sort of ICPs. >> You kind of want your content your personal brand to accompany for both of those types of pillars if that makes sense. So we usually say you want to have like sort of like maybe five to

seven. Uh and it also very much depends on your goal. So, if you're looking for very specific business growth over a short period of time, I would say you're probably going to want to focus more on the expert pillars. >> If you're looking to blow up and, you know, grow a massive brand and then attract attention that way, I would say you probably want to focus more on the

interest pillars, >> right? >> It's very dependent on what you want, but we would usually say maybe like five to seven pillars, some within the interest, some within the expert, and they should all align towards your business. Essentially, even with interest pillars, for example, it will be things that even though they're much

broader, they can still kind of link into your business and you can still have some storytelling elements in there that relate to your business. For Chris, did did is that what you have as well? >> Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So, for Chris, his goal was, as I said, to like become the most recognized entrepreneur in the world. And so, for him, it was very much focused on uh the interest pillars at

first. So, we had I think like four or five. It's like leadership and business culture, AI, business and entrepreneurship growth, personal development. Uh, and the goal was to blow up in those those topic areas um to reach as many people as physically possible. And then as we've kind of like grown throughout the last 18 months or so, we've slightly changed. We've

slightly become a little bit more niche with things, especially as it's launched uh the new business searchable, we've actually pivoted our strategy um to go more into marketing to search to AEO, GEO, that sort of thing. So, >> it's been a fun one. A lot of people will think that their positioning at the start is like something that they have to have for the entirety of their

personal brand. >> Yeah. You can actually pivot pretty easily if you focus on we call it pre-validated content. So this is content that performs well across multiple different uh creators. It's like outlier content essentially. You can find ideas within a specific industry that you're looking to go into, you're looking to talk about. It

basically means you can slowly start to pivot your brand and you can change it based on the business goals that you have. Let's say I settled on my pillars which were kind of broader marketing, creator economy, entrepreneurship, personal brand, and then maybe the niche stuff would be uh maybe more like podcast industry specific maybe like case studies and and

things like that from from from clients. I settle on then what what do I do next? >> Okay, so the next thing and it's quite an underrated thing in my opinion is optimizing your profile page. Okay. >> So, when we say that, we basically mean turn your profile page on LinkedIn like a landing page for a website, >> right? >> So, it needs to have a very like clear

um and confident profile photo like professional headshot. Basically, doesn't have to be anything like really high-end budget as long as it's not like a selfie or a picture with makes or anything like that. Yeah. >> Um and then you have a few sort of key areas within your profile where you can actually drive a lot of people to your business already and towards the goal

that you already have. So you have the banner which sits just above your profile photo. That's a really underrated place in my opinion. A lot of people actually don't even have a banner or it would just be like some generic one with their logo in the bottom corner. >> You can drive people towards a certain action. So for us, one of the key

focuses is to get people on Chris's newsletter. And so we will have very like specific image um that is all within his brand colors and drives people. It says, you know, I clicked the the newsletter link in the featured section, for example. And so when people comment on his page straight away, like the first thing they see obviously is his face. And then right at the top with

the banner, it's like newsletter already. Like so they're on their page and they know that he's got a newsletter and he wants you to check it out. So that's one of the first things. And then after that, you have the tagline, which again is something that I think uh not enough people pay attention to because with a tagline, when you're commenting on other people's posts on LinkedIn, you

can see the name and you can also see the tagline as well. Yeah. >> So, it's a great way to show what you're about, what your goal is, and who you help. And unfortunately, there's not like a magic formula for the tagline. Very dependent on your goals, which is why, you know, I said about setting that why in the first place. You can have very like lead specific taglines, which

is like we help seven to eight figure entrepreneurs uh build podcast empires, for example. I would say it's a little bit more specific. Or you can have something that's a little bit more generic. If you're looking for that like explosive personal brand growth, you would say like I talk about uh marketing, the creator economy, uh AI or whatever it may be. Yeah.

>> Essentially just a space where people can come in and see what your profile is about, what sort of content you're posting about already, and who you're helping effectively. So you have the profile, the banner, the tagline. You also have the featured section too which is um again most people will just put up an old post that's done well. Here you can actually use this to drive more

people towards your business, your website or whatever it may be. >> Um and you can nicely like you can edit these. So you can have it like very branded. So if you have like a a branded banner for example with your own colors uh and pointing towards certain thing, you can do the same thing with the featured section. So you can have like for us obviously it's it's the

newsletter. We have another call to action there um as well as uh the creator accelerator link as well. So driving people towards that page. And it basically just means if people have seen your content, they click on your profile, they already know exactly what you're doing, what your offer is, you know, what sort of content you post already. Really underrated way of

showing what you're about, basically. >> Yeah. I always find this with clients and creators. They start creating, but they forget to actually think about what happens if I blow up. Yes. >> So, or even worse, which is they start creating and they do blow up >> and then it's crickets to the business or the service or whatever because they've actually forgot to set the

infrastructure. So, this this kind of feels like the infrastructure. >> Yes. >> And I'm looking at it and I'm lo I'm loving it. It is so well optimized here. There's so much to it. So, we'll definitely kind of have it up on screen as as Josh is talking it through. But yeah, I guess if if you do blow up, then someone comes to the page presumably and

they immediately see step-by-step newsletter delivers actionable advice on business and growth. Join 400,000 people receiving weekly tips. Subscribe in my in my featured section. You've even got a little image of where it looks really valuable and there's loads of stuff. I can't actually see what it is, but it looks valuable. It looks like I should probably sign up for it. And then it

says founder follow for post on business marketing and AI. All pretty interesting topics. I guess if I'm interested in those things, it would appeal to me. >> There's actually also a website link. Is that fairly new on on LinkedIn? It says searchable weight list. I could join. >> Yes, >> that's quite interesting. >> It's quite a new feature. Another spot

within the profile as well. So, this is like the first thing that we teach people when they join the creative accelerator is like, you know, you really want to optimize that in every capacity to drive people towards your offer. Um because if you had two people who had the same business, you know, person A and person B, person A has maybe a profile photo, no banner, no

information about their business at all, and person B is like completely optimized and you see the exact same content and you click on their profiles. Instantly, you're going to trust person B a lot more. It seems far more legit and it's just inherently clear to where you actually need to go if you want to, you know, be a part of their business, for example. There's a lot of social

proof on here as well and the use of the images is really good. So again, in the features section, subscribe today. Join 250,000 people receiving my newsletter with actionable business advice and then apply to the Creator Accelerator, which is your education product. Learn how I grew my LinkedIn from 30K to 1 million in 24 months. So again, there's like quite a nice

>> uh bit of value I'm presumably going to get if I click on that. I am going to click on it. Um, that's >> I'm already on the newsletter and I'd love to get into your funnel for the 10 million revenue education business. So, we'll get into that, >> but I presume the next step from optimizing this is what starting to think about actually creating.

>> I mean, you've got a few more sections you can make use of the about section as well. This one, again, it's not necessarily a magic formula. People will tell you to do it in certain ways. It's usually based off their own experience. We find the best approach is just sharing more of your story in there. So actually sharing like what you've done and going a little bit deeper on who you

actually are because I think that just makes the most sense for an about section and you can also drive people towards certain links whether it be your business or a certain contact for example like an email to reach out to a commercial manager or you know uh anything specific like that. >> Yeah, there's a lot of building trust here and

>> getting your story. So the short life story Chris has got age 21 did this age 22 left uni and started Ver Brands age 27 acquired age 28 won Bugatti as a client age 30 sold the business age 31 founded this other company raised 35 million so all of a sudden I'm educated on Chris and I can see he sounds pretty legit and interesting in a way that most people on LinkedIn from their page I

would have no idea what their backstory was and I would be unlike likely to trust them, but he sounds pretty legit and interesting. Sounds like he's making stuff happen and doing interesting stuff. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it definitely helps that he is genuinely a very impressive entrepreneur. That's helpful.

>> Yeah. He's got a lot of credibility. But yeah, I mean, it's so important to communicate that >> because a lot of where most entrepreneurs go wrong is they don't necessarily want to uh brag about it or talk about their achievements in a way. And so the about section is just a really nice way to kind of do it in an authentic way where you're sharing your

story, you're sharing a few of your achievements, and like you said, you're just trying to build trust with people, trying to get them to, you know, come come on your page as a visitor, someone that doesn't necessarily know you and instantly know what the offer is and who you actually are. >> Yeah, that's really good. Actually, the only thing he could improve here or you

could improve is actually have a failure on there. Yes, >> I think that would actually be that would be nice because then there would be uh again that ele element of depth. >> I think that's always good a bit of transparency on a failure >> 100%. >> Quick one. Over 80% of the people who watch this channel are not subscribed.

So if you're getting value from these episodes, please subscribe to the channel. It helps me book bigger and better guests and create more value for you. I'd really appreciate it. So please subscribe. So is my profile p uh page done now once I've changed all those things? >> Yeah. Okay. >> I think so. Yeah.

>> Cool. Then do I start creating content? >> So once you've optimized your profile, I think the next stage actually is and this is something that people don't do enough in my opinion is focusing on your network and your relationships. >> So before you even start creating content, you can find out so much information that is actually going to inform your strategy moving forwards.

For example, is it some um lady came to me the other day and she was like, "Oh, I'm trying to find uh sort of key ideas within my area. I want to like start building out this LinkedIn strategy." I spoke about finding creators to uh take inspiration from. One because you can see the kind of core topics that are resonating and two because they've built up very specific audiences as well which

you can tap into. Yeah. >> And so when I say like uh your network and your relationships with people, I basically just mean becoming a little bit more vocal in comment sections. Um starting to spot patterns with things like what are the key things that people are actually talking about. Yeah. And if you do this in a very like specific and focused way with your ICP, instantly

you're just getting like flooded with data and information about your ICP and you're understanding the exact types of content that they're trying to consume, the stuff that they like, the, you know, maybe the opinions that they disagree with, what they do agree with. Uh, and that just informs so much of your strategy. I honestly think you can make quite an impression on people just

through commenting alone, >> right? >> Yeah. I think people they kind of like separate like creating content with engagement, but I actually think they kind of like come together in a little bit. Yeah, you can become known within a specific space just through commenting and just through like leaving genuinely thoughtful and inspiring comments

>> mainly because one now LinkedIn is flooded with AI comments. >> Yeah. >> And so naturally you're going to stand out to those comments. We actually did this when we was like slowly pivoting Chris's brand to talk more about search. basically found the top um search SEO creators and we made sure that we were commenting um with Chris's account, you

know, sharing really valuable information um getting involved in certain conversations and this just made him a little bit more of a known voice around that community space. uh because LinkedIn is very communitydriven and so if someone who is consuming the same content, they're consuming, you know, SEO content all the time and they see Chris's name uh in the comments are, you

know, making a really interesting remark here or making a joke about SEO here. It shows that he really understands the community and instantly you're going to trust him straight away. Even though you haven't even, you know, maybe even seen his content already, you just know that he's involved within the community and he kind of knows what he's talking about cuz he's leaving like genuine thoughtful

comments basically. So I presume there's a thing there around you're also stealing someone's reach there as well in a way or you know you're contributing but you're also they've done the hard work their post is is done well already and you're just making sure you you land and you're present in front of all of the people that follow them. So >> how do you do that? Is there a system

there? Because >> I'm familiar in the past with you know there's a group chat and we all comment on each other as soon as we post. Um, I'm familiar also with like setting notifications on certain people so that when they post something, I'm the first to comment. And >> ironically, George Mack, who's a great creator, I noticed he's one of the first

people to comment on a lot of Chris's posts. >> So, do you recommend a system there like to actually kind of make sure you do that or is it just like by chance that you log on and you just make you you comment on five things at a time or how do you approach it? you completely um systemize it. So the easiest approach is just the notifications.

>> Um if you block out all the other notifications like post u you know like comments and likes on your own post and you just have the creator uh notifications, you can use that. Uh another approach is like having all of like creators in like a sheet with the time that they're posting as well. Uh you can just go through and make sure that you're you know one of the first

people to comment. >> Yeah. What you were saying with kind of like stealing the reach of other creators, we call it like piggybacking on their audience. >> Yeah. Uh, and so you're right, if you're nice and early on that and you leave like a genuinely strong comment, yeah, you can make quite an impact, um, which is which is pretty good. We also have

like different types of comments that you can make as well. So, we have like the entertaining/oke/me comment. We have like the storytelling comment which is like >> I think actually really nicely supported by an image as well. You have like the contrarian take, which is like where you go against a common belief or, you know, the status quo essentially. Mhm.

>> Yeah, there are multiple different approaches that you can take and I think doing all of them really cements you as a voice within the community that deeply just understands the industry as a whole. So yeah, it's it's completely systemizable. You can also do it with, you know, if you've got like a VA for example. I think that's another interesting piece that that people uh

typically uh usually against is, you know, having someone comment as you. >> Yeah. >> It makes a lot of sense if you are a founder who has multiple different businesses or you're just someone that's really low on time. to train up a VA to know exactly how you talk, your exact opinions, and >> essentially comment as you.

>> People often get offended and like, oh, why is it not you? But like, if you think about it, you know, you think of Alex Hamos, Steven Bartlett, like they're not in the comment sections themselves. They've got so many other things on. >> Yeah. They've got a social manager. >> Yeah. >> Exactly. Exactly. And as long as the

people who are doing the commenting for you like know you inside out, I think it's it's very worthwhile for a lot of entrepreneurs. We do recommend commenting a lot as yourself first. I think that's a great way of really understanding the community. Yeah, just getting very clear on your ICP and the types of content that they kind of consume. We're very uh systemizable with

Chris's brand whereas like >> he will do a certain thing for a certain period of time and then he will train people to do that thing over time and it's just like >> is there a set amount of comments you're doing each week or is it like a certain number of people that you always comment on their stuff? like what's what would be recommended to me there.

>> If I'm going to say to Jonas, I want you to do 10 a week or I want you to respond to everything someone these five post is is what's the best? >> So the first thing we say is is always respond to your audience. That's like number one key thing. So >> obviously >> on your own posts like >> it sounds so obvious but a lot of people

will ignore it. They'll post and then they'll just go off the platform. Yeah. >> So we will always engage with the audience. We'll try and provoke better conversation there. Uh then when we're going with like other creators, we are quite systemized with it within it where we, you know, will comment on certain people's um uh posts just because they're very involved within a certain

uh community. And so um yeah, we will like make sure that we're around and we're active within that space. But then I also think it's really important to comment on new creators as well. We actually have a system um that we recommend within the creator accelerator which is 30 3010. So 30% of your comments should go towards uh larger creators and the sole

purpose of that is to piggy back from that audience. More people to kind of take their views and get people to recognize you from that. The second one is people within your industry. So these key voices, they may not necessarily be massive creators, but they're people that have a really strong following. Yeah. >> And a really strong audience who are

directly related to the kind of audience that you're going after. >> The third one is your ICP. >> Okay. So, as I said, if you're within that network, you're within the comments, you can really get a good understanding of who your ICP is. >> That's a great idea, actually. >> And yeah, and if they're creating content, and this might be a little bit

tricky, some people, and well, the high majority of people won't actually be creating content. >> Yeah. >> And so, you have to get quite creative on how you can start engaging with them. One strategy might be they may not be creating content, but their company is creating content. >> And you know, a lot of companies

internally like, "Ah, hey guys, can you support the company page?" And so if you become pretty active on there, you're kind of cementing yourself within that team already. So they already know who you are from that, which I think is a pretty good approach. Um, you know, colleagues as well might be an interesting approach. So they may not be creating content, but their colleagues

might be creating content and therefore you can kind of go on start engaging with that. If they are someone within a similar division, they will probably be talking about similar things and again you just become known um within your sort of ICP audience there, which is great. And then the 10 is for traditional colleagues, friends, you know, people that you want to get and

support within the journey of posting content because it is difficult. >> You know, it's great to get support from your friends. >> Yeah, that makes sense. So, I've got my comment system down. That sounds really good and that sounds easy and achievable. >> Then do I start looking at creating? >> Yes. Yes.

>> Okay. Give us the gold here. Like how do we get to 3 million followers very quickly? >> Okay. Okay. So, if the goal is pure growth, which is what our goal essentially was when I joined Chris, you have to think about, okay, what is the type of content that is going to drive as much follower growth as possible. >> Yeah.

>> So, when I first joined Chris, he was very good at going viral. He was very good at saying specific things that just resonated with a mass audience. And so, his posts were generating in the time like hundreds of thousands of likes, which on LinkedIn was like unheard of back in the day. Yeah, >> it's actually very hard to do that now. But 2 years ago, it was doable, but it

wasn't necessarily converting into followers because people would see on the feed and oh yeah, like I relate to that. I'm going to like it, maybe drop a comment and then scroll on. So the goal when I joined was how can we increase the follower conversion significantly? How can we effectively become the fastest growing creator in the world? And to do that, you have to kind of like

break down the psychology of someone using LinkedIn uh and why they would actually follow you in the first place. Uh and the majority of that is through educational depth like high in-depth content basically. So content that makes you go wow like this has taught me something significantly interesting. This will benefit me. And I think another key thing as well is making it

super actionable. Like if you can create something where someone can effectively do a certain thing and within minutes get a you know a little bit of a result from it instantly they're like wow okay this person has taught me this. I've done this. has worked and now I want to like follow them. I want to learn more about this sort of thing. Yeah. If you understand why people will follow you on

the first place, then that's a pretty good starting point. So, how do we engineer our posts to drive those conversions to followers and people who take action? Is that like monitoring per post what drove the most follows? I heard Chris also talking about how you would look at different creators and every day at like 9:00 a.m. he would in the morning just have a look at what

their follower account was. >> Yes. >> And he'd notice, okay, well, this person here, they're growing really fast. >> This person here isn't growing so fast. So, what is it that they're doing? >> Yes. >> Is there some some tactics there that that work? >> Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. You you

definitely done your research as well. I love that. When I first started, we were um very manual with it because there wasn't any tools about that could actually do this sort of thing. >> And so, you're right, we would literally track. We had certain creators that we knew um would have a similar audience to Chris and they were growing on LinkedIn and we like, okay, you know, which

specific posts, which specific topics are they talking about that people are like, "Wow, this is interesting enough to me for um to to drop a follow." Basically >> another thing as as well is uh and this is specifically on LinkedIn is formats. So the algorithm as it is right now is really focused on dwell time like a lot of uh social media um platforms and

carousels and cheat sheets things that go really deep on a certain subject is the thing that makes people stop you know spend time actually like try and figure out and learn about like what you're trying to tell them. Um, and that that dwell time is like a good signal to the algorithm and therefore it pushes it out to more people as well. So I think the reason that we grew so quickly one

was because we were tracking, you know, the best creators, what sort of topics within Chris's Chris's content pillars that would grow his account. That was the first thing. And the second thing was we were the fastest to adapt formats. So there is multiple examples here where we would like and this would come just specifically from spending time on LinkedIn. We would find uh or we

would try and find outliers from creators who would have you know smaller accounts or small smaller followings and they would share something in a certain format that has like disproportionate growth in comparison to something else. Um so one of the first things when I joined him was carousels. Carousels like kind of just come out at the time uh and they were things that were driving like

massive massive follower growth. So we were like, "Okay, we'll go from these like single images that he was doing already and we'll start going into carousels." That was the first thing. It was really random, but there was um a time where LinkedIn uh just created like a link shortener. And so people who were using this like link shortener or who were sharing links within their posts

were going like insanely insanely viral. >> Um and this I think was fascinating because a lot of people were quite slow to jump on it. >> Yeah. Yeah, >> cuz a lot of the LinkedIn gurus were saying like um you shouldn't have uh links in your post. You shouldn't be going taking people off platform. Uh and so a lot of people were quite

apprehensive when it came out. Whereas we were like straight on it. We were like, okay, we've seen it have disproportionate growth for a smaller creator. >> How can we jump on this? How can we maximize and capitalize on this? And so we did um it's funny. I think Chris spotted it whilst he was at like a care show for Lotty.

>> Like sent me the post and he was like, "Hey, let's jump on this straight away." you know, let's blend it in with our own content. Uh, and we did so. And that post, I think, drove like something between like 8 to 10,000 followers. >> Wow. >> Just from one post. >> Wow. >> And it was like quite a simple post. It

was quite a broad post. I think it was like um like seven TED talks in in 7 days or something like that. But because it was using this new format that LinkedIn were like kind of pushing at the time to get people to use it a little bit more, it drove like significant outcomes. One of the main things uh within our approach because we were so focused on that follower growth

was if we see something working, we're going to double down on it and go very very hard on it. And so for that week, instead of being like, oh, you know, maybe we should do an image post here, we were like, nope, we know this works. We're going to double down on it. Pretty much every single post is going to have links. We're going to obviously change the topics up so it doesn't get really

like repeated and boring. Um but we're going to use the same format. And this drove like significant significant growth. So when I joined he was at 108,000. Um, we set a goal of like 250,000 by the end of the year, which was 3 months. >> Um, and I remember seeing that goal and being like, "Wow, that is ambitious." >> Yeah, that's going to be difficult. But

because we found these these small little format changes, we managed to go from 108,000 to 350,000. >> Wow. >> Within 3 months. >> That's crazy. That's insane. >> It was quite mental to the point where it like surprised both of us. we, you know, we were very much um consuming like we were very much on the platform

for for a lot of time. Um but when we were doing it and we were seeing the days like we'd have some days genuinely where we would do like 15,000 followers in like one day. >> Wow. >> Which like on LinkedIn was completely unheard of. >> Yeah. >> It just kind of like skyrocketed uh

Chris's account. And I remember those targets. was like 250,000 by the end of the year, 500,000 by um the year after, and then 750,000 by like 18 months. Within 6 months, we were at 750,000, which was absolutely crazy. Yeah, it was mind-blowing. By that point, we uh decided that, hey, like we're pretty good at this. Um you know, maybe we can start like coaching people. And and that

was when the whole education business idea came up. One of the things I love about this podcast is all the actionable frameworks and strategies that my guests give me. So, if you want a copy of everything Josh has talked about so that you can implement it for yourself and your business, then you can get a copy at the link in the description, I really hope you enjoy it and I'm sure you will

get value from it. Yeah. So, in in all of those posts, and I guess in in my posts if I'm creating, are there call to actions in those posts that are driving those followers, or are people just really enjoying the content, the carousel, the image, the the the written text, and going, "Yeah, I'm going to follow for more." >> Or do you actually encourage people with

a clear CTA to subscribe and follow for more? >> Yes. Yeah. It sounds really obvious, but like the easiest way to convert someone into a follower is simply reminding them to follow your account. It's hilarious. Like people will see it on, you know, big creators accounts like, oh, they're always asking for a follow and all that, but it's just a simple reminder because,

you know, you may be reaching like different audiences and if they come on your post, they read it, they get value from it, and it's like, oh, you know, follow me. They can click on your uh name, you can obviously tag yourself on LinkedIn, click your name, they go on your account, and they can follow you. And it's just so easy for them. It makes it like super frictionless. uh and it's

just an obvious way of um asking people to follow. Yeah, I think that's like one of the main uh ways, but I think the format, how you represent the information and we actually have like a system for how to effectively write the the perfect post that's going to convert followers as well. Yeah, following that system is important as well. Okay, so let's get into that system. But I'm just

looking at a couple of posts and I can see how you lot guys have mastered it because it seem when you see these posts, it's so obvious. It's so well optimized. Yeah. What does the perfect post look like? >> The first thing is having an idea that is revalidated as I mentioned. So something that has worked well before either for a smaller creator and it's

performed disproportionately either for yourself previously as well like repurposing that idea or for a big creator and even for the big creator it's like kind of an outlier within their current posts. Um so it's understanding within your industry within you know an area which your business is focused in which pieces of content which ideas which topics are

going to drive the most followers. >> That's the first part like starting within the ideation stage. It's something that a lot of people often miss. They will like try and really focus it on them and their business and I guess create for themsel like to almost like strict their ego a little bit and like make it very personalized. >> Um whereas we're constantly like it

should be focused on your audience. You should be providing education and value to your audience, making sure it's actionable and so forth. >> So that's the first stage like the idea. The second part is then how can we show that idea in a way that is um super actionable and people can share it with loads of other people. So we will typically start with like the image or

you know the carousel for example um and we make sure that we have topics that have certain breakdowns or frameworks that are actionable. So, uh, an example might be a productivity cheat sheet, and it has different frameworks like the 2-minute rule or >> Pomodoro method, >> Pomodoro, the Eisenhower matrix. Exactly. So, it's having those sort of

frameworks where people can use them and apply them and get value from them straight away. Um, and it's visualizing that information so it stands out on the feed. Again, that's another underrated thing. People will not invest in the design and not invest in how they represent the information as well. It's just such an easy way to stand out if you have beautifully designed cheat

sheets or carousels. It's just so much easier for people to like stop when they're scrolling. >> Yeah, there's one here. Master problem solving. Use these seven mental models to make better decisions. >> And then there's seven and they've all laid out beautifully with graphics. Is Chris coming up with this or like you're finding you just said you're you're find

looking at smaller creators looking at what's outperformed for them. What does that process look like for coming up with these topics? Is it all based on okay we want to talk about entrepreneurship business marketing and AI so let's have a look for posts that are doing well there and then we take those ideas and then make our own version of it.

>> Yes. Completely completely. Yeah. So Chris specifically at the start was like so involved with with like ideation >> and like finding these certain posts that he thought that he could add more either information on or his own experience and effectively improve that type of content as well. >> Um that's another thing I would say if if you're taking like a pre-validated

idea it's looking at that idea seeing why it's done well and then going okay how can I make this even better? like if this is the starting point, how can I make it so good that like there is no reason why people wouldn't follow me for this type of content? >> Yes. >> Um and so yeah, he was very involved in the ideation process. Uh we work

together so so closely um creating this content for literally like 18 months to the point where like I I'm like basically in his head when it comes to content like I can see the exact things that he likes, the exact topics that he likes talking about. But how do I find my pre-validated ideas? Because then do I am I literally looking at other people's pages and scrolling

through and >> yes, >> like looking at the top people in my niche or people in my niche I find interesting and just scrolling through and going, "Okay, this one got 500 >> likes versus this one only got 10, so there must be something here." >> And I add that one to my list of ideas. >> Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, we have

what we call like a creator inspiration bank where we have like basically um across all of your um pillars, your content pillars. You have just a list of creators who are like growing within that niche, right? >> And it doesn't necessarily mean they have to be growing as in like a follower growth. It could be they're getting like a lot of engagement. You can see that

they've got a nice community there. >> And just having like a super tight list of people for each content pillar. That's like a really easy way to get inspiration quickly. >> Mhm. You can actually like custom create a feed on LinkedIn as well. Um, it's like an old school tactic that I'm not sure how many people know about it, but you can basically if you go on the

search, I'm going to try and do this off the top of my head. Um, you go on the search, you click enter, there's like the post settings, you can then in the post settings uh like type a certain creator. >> Uhhuh. >> You can there like posts will come up in a in a select feed and you can do that for multiple creators. So, if you have

this creator inspiration bank, you can have, you know, maybe like 10 people. Um, and you put all their names in and you have like a legit feed from just those 10 creators and then you just bookmark that feed and it refreshes each time so you can come back to it time and time again. Nice >> and it's just a super easy way where you can just get like inspiration um, you

know, from the creators that you want to take inspiration from >> basically. Would that be like at the start of the month or the start of the week that I'm running that process? Yeah. So we we recommend you do it within like the early phases. So you've got your profile optimized. You've then you know become a little bit more of a voice within the community space. Then

the next stage is okay trying to find these people who are producing really high value content trying to get those ideas and those topics in. And you should have it to the point where you're consuming that type of content so much that you and you're talking to the ICP within the comment section that you have a very good idea even off the top of your head of what sort of ideas will

resonate with the audience that you're trying to attract. And once you have that in place, that's when you can start thinking, okay, I know this topic is is really important. I know a lot of people are talking about it. How can I create a beautiful cheat sheet or a carousel that communicates genuine value that hits that topic area? >> Interesting. Interesting. So, what would

be a good example of that for you guys? >> For Chris specifically, I I think this is really interesting because we had already built like an audience that was focused on business building, AI, leadership and culture. I think the pivot into search was was fascinating for us. Um, and so we essentially took that strategy as like starting from from fresh again, that that whole pivot. And

so we got deeply involved within the SEO community. We found the top SEO creators who had posts that were performing disproportionately, that were growing, that had an tightly engaged audience on them, and we just essentially saw the posts that they were creating, uh, applied extra information, extra resources, Chris's own knowledge about building this business as well. uh and

we would aim to like improve within those certain topic areas and release content that was uh within like a similar format. So uh a good example would be old SEO versus new SEO. That format is something that works across like multiple different niches as well. It's so obvious, but like just a clear comparison of like this is what it used to be like, this is what it is now.

Because I think people see that and it's like oh they feel updated. It positions you as someone that's on the verge of like the technology of understanding what's happening within the industry and we would essentially present that information like old SEO versus new SEO and sort of build that community around the SEO um space. >> That is so interesting. I mean it's so

true what you say as well cuz I'm already I feel like I'm going through this process with you now just by looking at Chris's page, looking at someone who's obviously successful on LinkedIn in a not too dissimilar niche. I can see he's going a much much broader with the topics he's doing. But just looking at the formats, I mean so much it's the same with all content, right?

It's just the people who are prepared to go further and deeper >> Mhm. >> are the ones who win. Like the the person who does the surface level, gets up LinkedIn, does the surface level post and presses send, they get a certain outcome, whereas the person who goes away and spends like three hours making the cheat sheet,

>> Yes. >> gets a certain type of outcome. We had Caleb who um built the personal brand of Alex and Leila Horoszi on the other week and you know on YouTube is where they're focusing but they create created this six-hour video. >> Yes, I saw that. >> It's done like 600,000 views. It's driven 20,000 leads to their business,

>> but they were just prepared using the Hoszi method of >> where everyone else would stop. That's where we're going to start. >> Yes. Yeah. But I love the formats here cuz there's a format here which is free report Q3 25 algorithm report. >> Yes. >> Then there's the kind of cheat sheets. Then there's the comparisons like OKRs

KPIs. >> What are the other formats that you really like? I've al there's like the AI image driven carousel. >> Like what are the other formats that do well here? And >> and what are some of the tactics there? cuz in some of these you're saying repost this. >> Mhm.

>> Some of these you're saying comment this. >> Yes. >> There's so much to cover. Yeah. As as Caleb says, it's it really is about how deep you go. And we make that so clear within our accelerator. It's like this will be the hardest 10 weeks. Like this is not easy. You know, like you're against uh people who have

content teams, people who really want to do this strategically and therefore you have to go so deep and treat it like a science. In terms of formats, you have the classic formats or I call them the classic formats like cheat sheets, carousels, image based posts, text posts. Uh you then have micro formats within each format. So uh a classic one is the comparison, old versus new. Um

you can have that on a cheat sheet and a carousel. So you can like split it down the middle. Um another one might be one particular thing versus another particular thing versus another particular thing. Just showing like the contrast between each points. We've done that with like LLMs for example like chat GBT versus Claude versus Gemini. That's uh another micro format. One that

we're seeing particularly do well recently and this is like from the Q3 algorithm report is these storytelling carousels which is something we haven't necessarily seen before. So uh a really great example of this is someone uh Cel Bloom. >> Yeah. >> He did some really nice like storytelling carousels where they're not

necessarily driven on like educational depth. They're just essentially they're educating you in a way that's wrapped around a story. So it might be like the empty boat mindset or the surfers mindset. Yeah. So like a a concept that you can explain through a story and it takes people on a journey. That's something that's performing pretty well at the minute. But yeah, there are so

many different areas within each format that you can kind of like tweak and optimize. In regards to the different call to actions, this is based on goals. Another format that is particularly working very well on LinkedIn right now is these lead magnet posts. um which is super obvious. You know, you provide an insane amount of value to people, they're going to want it, and they're

therefore going to want to be more involved within whatever your brand is. With those posts, the the sheer goal is to get people subscribed to uh whatever it is you're you're trying to attract them to. So, it might be a newsletter, uh it might be specific segment that you're attracting to so you can, you know, put them in an email sequence where you can encourage them to do a

certain thing like buy a course or whatever it may be. Uh, and so within these lead magnet posts, there's a very specific call to action, a very specific, we call it like a viral mechanic, which is, you know, comment X and I will give you why basically. >> Yes. >> Um, it's super straightforward, but it works because people will then comment

that, you can then reply, and there are multiple different approaches you can do it as well. You can either reply with a link to the landing page, and you know, they can go straight through that way. You can also say, "I'll send you a DM as well." But because they're commenting that and you're replying it, it just means that you're getting like a lot of comments, a lot of engagement on your

post, which means the post is going to do better in general. Uh, and then it's going to reach more people and then you get more people downloading and more newsletter subscribers as well. >> Is that also one of the unique things around LinkedIn where if someone in my network comments on something quite often I get shown that? I don't think that happens on other platforms. Yeah,

that was something that was very prominent um over the last like 2 years or like 18 months. It's it's not as uh effective as it once was. >> Yeah. >> But yeah, it used to be the case that like if you can drive comments and conversations, it will get shown in people's feeds. >> So, another like quick uh tactic as well

is like trying to encourage conversation within your comments. So, we will always have like an engagement question, something that allows people to talk about themselves. Um, because people do want to talk about themselves. They want to share their story. They want to share, you know, what they've been through. And so, if you can have like a specific question that people like, oh

yeah, like I'm going to comment on this and share, you know, what's happened with me. Um, and then you can provoke that even more by replying and asking another question. Oh, this is really interesting. What happened here? Or, you know, did you get the results that you wanted? Blah, blah, blah. And then you're starting these conversations within your posts and you're getting all

of these comments and engagement towards your post and it's naturally going to promote it in comparison to other posts. >> So what would be a good example of that? Like on this post eight strategy frameworks for fortune 500 com companies. Would I do it on that type of post? >> Yes. So if you scroll down you should see an engagement question on there.

>> Oh yeah. Which framework can you see yourself implementing today? Drop a comment. Interesting. Yeah. So there there's quite a few CTAs. There's a comment and then there is a CTA to the newsletter and then there's a repost as well. >> Yes. Yeah. >> So there's like multiple CTAs which I would have thought would have like be uh

something not to do but >> that seems to work for you. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We Yeah. We'll try and keep like a specific focus. So for example, if one post we're like, okay, the goal here is to uh show a certain topic. We want to drive people towards the newsletter. We're going to expand on that topic within the newsletter. We usually have the um newsletter as like

the main call to action that comes a little bit further up the post. Um we will always have the engagement question. We will always have the repost and follow um call to action just because like it's just so simple, but it helps with the growth of the post itself. Yeah, for the most part we will be driving people towards the newsletter as the main one, unless it's something

that's like a little bit lighter touch, you know, something that we want to go maybe like more like broader and viral with, but not necessarily like really depth and educational, then we'll just have like a repost and a follow call to action. But for the most part, it will be driven towards the newsletter. >> Very cool. So, I really want to get into the funnel and then the business behind

this, but is there anything else on the content that is really worth knowing or avoiding? >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's Yeah. I just realized as well I said we have the system. I talk about I spoke about two things and then forgot the rest. So, I'll just break down quite quickly um what people can do. So, once you have the idea, you have the cheat sheet,

you've created this beautiful thing that stops people on the scroll, you then want a really strong hook. Now, uh, an interesting one on LinkedIn. Our general rule is you should be able to like cover your content and people should know exactly just from the first two lines uh, what your content's going to be about. And so there is character limits as well. And by character limits, I mean

when you write the hook on LinkedIn, it has to see more >> and most people forget about that and they'll like write a hook and then it'll just come off and cut off and that can cause a little bit of friction. People like not really interested scroll on. And so we try and keep it within the character limit which I think is something like 65 and 40

>> I think for like one and line two. >> That's the first thing with the hooks itself. We have tested multiple different variants. We've found that the line paragraph break line is the most effective. So some people will do for example line and then two paragraph breaks or some people do three lines. Uh but we've just had the line paragraph break line is the most effective. There

are multiple different variants of hooks that you can use. You can use uh statbased hook. There is like a contrarian hook. There is like an open promise hook. We found the ones that have been the most effective are those that have numbers in them as well because that serves as a bit of a pattern interrupt. >> So, you know, there are so many posts

that have text on them, even just a simple number. And we find the more interesting and bizarre a number as well, the more effective it can be. >> I've studied over 318,842 LinkedIn posts. That sounds like a weird amount of hosts. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that genuinely that was the data set, but um yeah, a lot of people would go, "Oh, no. Let's

just have like 300,000 plus." >> That looks interesting, though. Yeah. Having all the different numbers. >> Yeah. Exactly. It just makes it feel more authentic. Um and it just stops you. And that's the whole goal of the hook. You just want to stop people from scrolling. For most posts, and this will depend because you'll have, you know, different posts serving different

purposes. But we will usually start with the hook. We will then have uh an expansion of the hook which aims to get into the emotions of your ICP and and people consuming the content. So it's kind of like the before stage of what this cheat sheet is going to be about. So say for example you got a cheat sheet on productivity or habits, productivity habits for example. You have the hook

which you know will be something that will stop the scroll. You will then have an expansion of that of like that basically talks about the problems and frustrations of people if they're not feeling productive or like you know maybe it's like talking about like procrastinating and like the effects of that. Just a very short segment where you're kind of expanding out. The goal

here is to get people to relate to it in the moment. So it's like oh okay I've seen this. Oh yeah, I've had this exact emotion. You then go into the bulk of the post which is effectively a summarized version of your image or carousel. >> Got it? The reason we do this is essentially to strengthen the sort of core education and message that we're

we're delivering. You know, people are different learners as well. You have visual learners that will just check the sheet. You have those that just read the text. And so we want to make sure that the messaging and positioning is clear on those. >> Yeah. >> You then have the like dream destination after that. So once you've applied this

device, these are the good things that will happen to you. And then we go into the call to action. >> Very nice. >> Um and that's kind of like the kind of perfect post so to speak. Another thing to mention as well that it has to be optimized for a scan. So we will do short sentences. We will do we'll write in lines of 1, two, and three. We'll

never do paragraph blocks. We want to make it so easy for people to read the content. We don't want to see a massive paragraph and I can't be bothered to read this and then scroll on. Yeah. >> Um so we'll make sure that there's lots of white space. It's super easy on the eye and it should feel like you're like reading it internally in your head and it's super easy to just kind of

understand and um learn from basically. >> Wow. I bet you've got in the accelerator you've got like a little map of this outright, haven't you? Where it says like hook, expand, >> make them feel heard. >> Yes. >> Or seen then explain the value of what you're about to to give them and then the call to action because that would be

insanely valuable. >> Yes. We we go insanely deep on it. We have like really long modules where we break down all of the science and that's for one particular post as well. >> There are multiple different posts that have different approaches that drive towards a certain outcome as well. So yeah, it is literally a science at this point. Like

>> cool. Well, we'll put a breakdown of some of those strategies and frameworks in in our newsletter and and so people can get a copy of that in at the link in the the description. Did you know that the highest converting call to action in podcasts is the share call to action? It actually beats a lot of the other organic growth tactics that you can deploy. Literally just getting people in

your audience to take out WhatsApp and send an episode to someone who could get value from it. So that's exactly what I'm going to do now. I'm going to ask you to take out your phone and if you're getting value from this episode and you think it could help someone that you know, please send it to them or share it with your team or pop it in your team Slack channel. We'd really appreciate

it. and thanks if you send it to someone. The same on all these platforms is that like these posts and content is not left to chance. There's a formula and there's a system and a process. >> Yes. >> And when you look at all the ones that have done well, they tend to always follow a certain type of system or process and then it's like software. You

can go in and switch up some of the things over time and see how it changes the performance. But yeah, it's so so interesting to hear you talk for it. you've obviously uh studied this and been in it for quite a long time, so it's it's super valuable. Anything else on the perfect post and and content that people should be thinking about >> with hooks as well? This is like a very

specific tip for hooks, but you want to have things that roll off the tongue easily cuz you have to remember that when someone's reading a post, they're reading it in their head. So, they've got this internal voice going on. And if you say something that's quite difficult to read in your head, then naturally it creates that friction with people. So we will always try and it sounds really

bizarre but we will think about okay we've got all these different types of like variations of hooks that we'll try what is the easiest to say out loud and we'll just like genuinely just go through and read them out loud and oh this is this felt quite nice roll off the tongue easily and so that's like a very small little tweak that you can make.

>> Yeah there's so much to talk about within like the the content and the perfect post like that's one part of the strategy. There's a whole like pyramid, whole funnel um as well, but that might take ages. >> Is that so? Is that because we basically have some posts which are kind of broader? Yeah. >> And some posts that are kind of more

geared towards conver conversion. >> Yes. Again, this is where most people go wrong. They will think about posting one kind of format and it's usually storytelling and they will just post that repeatedly and repeatedly to try and get them associated with a certain topic. But really, I think a much better approach is having like a classic marketing funnel. So you have the top of

funnel. The goal is to get, you know, broad reach, attention, as many people coming onto your profile as possible. You then have the middle of the funnel. This is the the time where you build trust. So it's the storytelling. It's showing behind the scenes. You're going a little bit deeper here. And then you have the bottom of funnel as well, which is like conversion. This is like driving

people towards a specific action. So this will be the case studies, the testimonials, um, you know, clear transformational things that people will want to achieve. for themselves and therefore want to work with you based on that. >> So we really treat the socials as a whole marketing funnel and there are also different areas that you can like

tune in on as a part of the funnel as well. So for example we have the newsletter which is a key area for us to build trust because on socials you can only write a certain amount of characters. The newsletter is a perfect space to you know really go deep on topics and really like overd deliver for people and so we have like the goal for for Chris obviously is majority growth

so we have a lot of top of funnel and then we will aim to bring people towards the newsletter and if they sign up for the newsletter then they're going to get really in-depth insight on AI on search on you know his kind of core pillars and that's what we use to build trust with people a lot of people will see like socials as like a onedimensional thing whereas like there are so many different

parts that you can use to kind of like take people through that journey from discovering you to buying your product. >> That's super interesting. Just in terms of tracking performance on the content, what do you track? Are there one or two metrics that are really important to be looking at? >> Yes. So, >> and you do it per post versus general

platform. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're Yeah. super specific with it. The first and most important metric is the repost. M the reason being is you want to distribute your content to as many different micro communities on LinkedIn as possible. And so that really should inform your whole topfunnel strategy. It's how can I make someone who consumes my content look

good by sharing a piece of content. >> Yeah. >> Because we have those people, you know, within, you know, colleagues or whatever that will share something like, "Oh, this is like so useful for me." Like, "Thanks so much." And that makes them look good. And so it's thinking about how do we create content that is super sharable and makes them look good for

sharing. And usually that's things that are, you know, beautifully designed. It's things that are less personal because that's where a lot of people go wrong. They go super personal things and it's like other people can't share that. >> Yeah. They can't put that in a Slack channel. >> Exactly. Exactly. >> Someone just had a baby on on put in the

Slack channel. Whereas like the report on your industry >> and you share that in the Slack channel of your company. Yep. >> That's like, oh, he's always ahead of the game, isn't he? >> Exactly. Is that's so true. And like you have to think of it like that. And for pretty much every piece of content, we will think, okay, like what will make

them look good for sharing this? >> And so the repost metric for us is super important. We will usually try and monitor it like previously, I think we had posts that within the first hour were hitting like a 20% repost rate. We were like, okay, this is going to bang. This is going to do very well. Yeah. Primarily because you're just getting distributed to all these different

communities. You know, it's driving more attention to your post. The second and third most important metrics which are more of a recent thing on LinkedIn and and we've actually discovered it more through this this algorithm report is the saves and sends >> as well. So I think this has been a feature from LinkedIn for quite some time but it's only recently that you can

actually track those now. >> Uh and so again it's it's how can we get someone to save something? Okay, we must go super in-depth on something. So, they save it and they're like, "Okay, I want to learn about this later." And how can we make it so they want to send it to other people, which is kind of the same kind of approach for the repost. It's like, how can we make it so they look

good sending it to someone basically? >> So, they're the key kind of metrics to focus on. Honestly, likes, views, in our eyes, not that important, >> unless we're, you know, trying to get as much attention on a certain post like a partnership post for example. We're not necessarily too focused on those. I think if you focus on the repost, you focus on the saves and the shares,

>> they kind of come into play anyway. You'll generally generate more views. Yeah. >> If you're being shared by multiple different people. >> That is so smart. >> Yes. It's never been our main focus. >> They're kind of depth metrics as well, aren't they? Like that's that's where you know something's actually hit.

>> Yeah. >> I mean, I can see, you know, Chris has just posted about having a baby. It's got a lot of likes, >> which is great. But in terms of like the depth there in terms of actually someone being able to take some action, >> learn something, build trust, >> Yeah. >> share it in in a Slack channel.

>> Yeah. >> Um that's true. >> It's probably uh probably not not there. What about the newsletter signups or anything like that? Do you do you track that per post or >> Yeah. Yeah. So we have like custom links that um we track with those. They were incredibly effective a year ago, >> right? It was one of our like primary

drivers towards a newsletter. Like we started the newsletter when um I more or less just started working there from scratch. >> And at the time because LinkedIn wasn't seen as this like distribution channel, we were driving thousands of people simply by just having >> please subscribe to the newsletter in the call to action.

>> Wow. >> And it it was generally at the point where we grew so quickly in in newsletter subs that the founder of kit, Nathan Barry, was like he messaged us and was like, "What are you guys doing?" Yeah, because like I've never seen anything like this. I've never seen organic growth like this. And so it was incredibly effective. Now it's not as

infected. I think as more people have clocked on and started doing it themselves, it's it's, you know, it's kind of oversaturated. But it can still work. I think if you use like the right approach, like I think >> the goal that we have is like, okay, we're going super deep on a topic on newsletter. How can we create social posts that lead nicely into that? And if

it has a natural lead in it, usually they they get some good growth from it. And the obvious one is is lead magnet posts. Like they will drastically increase the subs that you get to your newsletter. >> That's really interesting because how many have you got on the on the newsletter? >> 250,000 in my closer to 300,000 but yeah

it fluctuates. >> Nathan's a client of ours actually as well. So it's always it's always interesting. I uh we should ask him who's growing fastest at the moment. That would be interesting. >> Yeah. Yeah. I think like the main driver for our newsletter growth now is the creator network. >> Yes. which I think is like just a genius

genius model. >> Yeah. Cuz when you go to sign up to yours, it then recommends Ramit, uh, Sahil, >> um, Eric Partaker, or a few others, I think. Right. >> Yes. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. >> Which which there's some really nice Yeah. tie in there and overlap between all of you. So, that's that's that's

effective. >> I saw a tweet from someone and they were basically just like, "My newsletter's grown by 2,000 subscribers. I have no idea why." It was like I didn't, you know, no none of my content went viral or anything like that, but they were just in a creator network with someone who went insanely viral and just drove all that attention to them, which is

just like fascinating because if you have creators who are primarily focused on growing their newsletter, you know, maybe they're spending money on ads to drive people in, everyone benefits from that like compound effect. It's just like such a hack for like getting fast newsletter growth within a specific audience. that feels like a nice place to move into the funnel and the the

product on a back end. >> How did that come to be and and what's what does that look like? >> We had the idea of of the creator accelerator business um primarily because obviously we had all of this growth and Chris was doing a lot of consulting on the side. So he was generally just doing like onetoone calls with people they were booking in and he

would always just be like completely at capacity. >> These like paid calls as well, right? So it's like was it on his newslet on the newsletter or something? It's like book a slot with me or on a LinkedIn page. >> Yeah, it was super simple. >> $500 or $1,000 or something. Yeah, >> that was it. We put it on and and like we were unaware of like at the start how

many people were really interested in it and so we were like oh we'll start I don't know I think it was like $800 or something was his first one and then it was just like bang sold out straight away. And at this point he was traveling and he was away. So he was like, "Oh my gosh." Okay. Um he did all those calls and then realized, "Okay, we need to, you know, actually bring price to a

point where it reflects demand." Yeah. >> And so we like increased it, increased it, and increased it. I think at one point he was doing like 1,500 or like 2,000 for a call, which is mental really. Like a >> doing a few a week or like opening a few slots a week. >> Yeah. Yeah. So I think he had probably like 15 to 20 slots a week.

>> Wow. >> Um and it was just great for him cuz him and Lou were traveling. It was like the first time that he had a break um from from building businesses. And then he was like, "Okay, >> that's not bad, is it? 15 20 grand a week." >> Yeah. >> Just from doing calls. Yeah.

>> And he's just like in the be on a beach like somewhere in the Bahamas, you know, chilling. Um and so the idea came from that. And he was like, you know, can we like scale this and do this with groups? And at that point when I first joined, he was like, I have a habit of making people entrepreneurs, which I like laughed at the time. But all throughout this journey, he's been like, "Oh, do

you want to do this business? Do you want to do that? Do you want this? And then he mentioned this and he was like we can you know create this like group educational product where people will go through an experience at the end they should have their LinkedIn their personal brand like significantly different driving real attention towards their business. And so we did that and I

think at this time he was on around like 800,000 followers. And so he was like let's find someone to replace you on the content side of things and let's like try and build this business together. We launched very quickly. Um I think we had the idea and within the space of like 2 months we were we were live with the the product. We had no idea initially of how many people would join. We had I think I

think we were going to cap it at 50 and then we like accidentally left like the the page still on and we got to like 69 uh people who had purchased. We had experienced, you know, like people getting results from onetoone coaching, but we I think drastically underestimated the impact of a group of people all towards like all focused on the same thing and like helping each

other within that space. And so we created this product based on like a lot of research. We found all of the, you know, products within the space and we were like, how can we improve this? How can we make this better? We wanted to basically create the best product on the market >> for us. We were like, "Okay, we can drive a lot of attention um towards

accelerator just through organic, just through Chris's account." Because he was getting so much attention, people interested, they wanted to book calls in. And so that first one there, there really wasn't much of a funnel. It was literally just organic growth and trusting Chris that it would work. >> Yeah. >> Um and we realized pretty early on if we

can get the best proof, the best results for people, it should be much easier to sell it kind of self in a way. And so we bled all of our time and resources into this first program. It was literally just me and him. Yeah. At this point, we had people helping set up the actual community space itself, but it was just me and him coaching, being really active within the community.

>> So is this is this like a it's like a cohort. It's like eight weeks or 10 weeks. >> 10 weeks. Yeah. >> 10 weeks. So is there a call each week? >> Yeah. So we had three calls uh a week. Mhm. >> So the way we worked, we were like, "Okay, we want material to break down all the knowledge that we have."

>> That was primarily my goal. My goal was like to help like build this product whilst he was doing sales and marketing for it. >> Um, and so at the time, this is when like AI wasn't great with writing either. And so it was literally I was just writing down everything from my head into these like 10 modules. It took ages, man. It took like

>> it was like a 30 to 40 page document. Wow. >> Just from like typing. >> Wow. >> And so we were like, "Okay, this is the launch date. we need to get 10 modules for the first one. It was just like so scrappy and we were just like I think I'd finished up to module four when we started.

>> So I had like up until those weeks to create the further six modules which was just a mad rush. Um but we got it done. Uh and it was probably the hardest I think we well I mean for me personally the hardest I've ever worked in my life. >> Yeah. >> But it just meant that yeah we had this product we would have three calls a week. One would be like an overview of

the module. So go over the key points you should focus on. The second one was a race my post which was done with me where people would put their links in and I would just like tweak and be you can do this, you can do this, you can do this. Uh we would then have a Q&A where people could ask any burning question they wanted and we like incentivized things with prizes and things like that

as well. That's cool. Yeah. Basically just meant that people really grew quickly. Like we we knew that the the method worked. We just were unaware of how well it would work in a group environment. And we had people genuinely in 10 weeks go from like 20,000 to 100,000. >> Crazy. >> Which is just like Yeah. Just like we

effectively created like the fastest growing creators um all within different niche spaces and it was just brilliant because then we were like as we were doing this we were like documenting a few things because the results were so good. We went straight into the second one. I think we were on like week seven of the first one and then we went straight into the second one.

>> Wow. >> Yeah. But we were marketing it within like week three or week four of the first one. And we went straight in and I think the second one was like 99 people. Again, this was primarily driven through organic traffic. >> So, LinkedIn and newsletter. Um, we weren't I don't think we even did any paid ads or anything like that. The ad

side of things and the funnel side of things came much later. It's been more of a recent thing. >> What were the price points for these cohorts? It >> was 5,000 for four payments and then 4,500 for one payment. Now it's 6,500 over four payments. No, over three payments and I think 5,000 or 5,500 for one payment.

>> Yeah. And so very high ticket. Um, you know, it's a lot a lot of money, but we have put so much time and effort into. >> Was the first cohort that much or was it a bit less? >> I think it was a bit less. So the Yeah, I think it was 4,500 single and then 5,000 something for over four. Yeah, we kind of were just blown away with with the demand. Like we

wanted to create the best product on the market. We wanted the best proof, the best evidence. >> We wanted to create it so we could just share the people who had the growth. You >> just tag their account and people just go and see. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's the beauty of it, right? >> It's the same way to grow any business

is case studies. So interesting as well how simple that that is. Did did you do anything in terms of is it in is it in like circle or one of those type online it is >> where you can post in the week as well? >> Yes. >> Would you give feedback on those posts where it's just on the calls or >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we had um a few

channels we we were very much like in the early stages like feedback driven. So we were like you know we have these ideas what would be the most beneficial channel to you? And it basically turned out to be key channels like we have module spaces where you would learn. Does each module have like a lesson as well or a template or something or >> It has a homework.

>> Homework. Yeah. Homework. >> Yeah. So, we wanted to make it actionable. So, we would have a module and then we would have an assignment. We would have a place where you could post your assignment and we would encourage people to comment on and to, you know, start conversations around that which just meant that you went from having, you know, yourself on the strategy to

now having hundreds of people just like, oh, I've seen this person do this or I've done that. It's also easier for them to learn when they see other people's stuff and it's easier to critique someone else than to critique your own stuff. >> Exactly. Exactly. And me and Chris were in these channels like daily providing like advice and like what we would do.

We then had like a post feedback channel where people would post in and we would give like specific feedback. We made it clear that, you know, it would take a little bit of time to get that that feedback. It wasn't going to be like completely straight away. Yeah. But we were like, if you put something in that channel and it's due to go out in three days, we will give you advice, you can

tweak it and then you can ship it out to that channel. We had a wins channel as well, which was my favorite channel because it was just a great place for people to share their progress, share, you know, really exciting things. Like we've had some insane insane results that like still blows my mind. And then we have a few other channels like tools and resources um like templates and

things like that. But we wanted to create maybe like five or six core spaces where people could have conversations where people could find information really easily. Yeah, that was kind of like the core offer of our product basically. >> How many years you you had that live now? 18 months. >> Started in July of last year. M are

there any key lessons like if someone's listening to this and they are thinking okay yeah I've got an audience or I'm going to grow an audience >> around my expertise and I think I could probably create a product that sells itself and is delivered in a cohort style environment. What would be kind of your key recommendations to them? >> This is an interesting one because I

think we were in a very rare situation with Chris. He is insanely credible already. He had already exited a business for $25 million. Like he already had this proof that he was an incredible entrepreneur. So naturally, we had a lot of trust with him in built already, which meant that even though we were optimized for growth, we still had a lot of people that were like, I still,

you know, trust what he says. He also made a very good impact on video as well, like very charismatic in events and things like that. And so we had like a kind of perfect situation there. If I was someone watching and I was like, "Okay, I'm trying to build an audience and then drive them towards a certain product, whether it be a cohort or a, you know, digital product, for example,

I would focus a lot more on funnels. I would focus on developing a relationship over time. You want to go really deep on educational content to show that you're an expert within that sort of area. You want to share your journey and your experience within that content as well. And then you want multiple different touch points. So, you know, you want to take people through a newsletter. One

simple thing that you can do is on the end of your newsletter, just having like a a thank you quiz. >> Super simple. Offer something that they get for filling in the quiz. So, it might be like, get this free playbook on how to grow on LinkedIn. They then fill in the quiz. You then have a lot of data on um the type of people that are subscribing to your newsletter. And

that's when you can start to really segment your audience and get a little bit more specific and personalized within your approach. So I would have um like broader content mixed in with like trust building people towards this newsletter. I would then really focus on how can I get as much data from them being on this page as possible. And then once you have the data that's when you

can go, okay, maybe I have, I don't know, 100 people who are earning more than $20,000. That's interesting. If that's like the the most popular audience out of the quiz. So, say you have a question that's like, "How much are you making monthly within your business?" You know, 0 to $500, $1,000 to $5,000, 10K plus, for example. And you find, okay, the person that's coming

on my newsletter is someone that is making more than 10K. Instantly, you're like, I can have a higher ticket product here. And that informs a little bit more of that strategy. If you get really specific on the questions, you can really figure out key things like what are the core pain points and frustrations they're having within your particular space. So for us it might be

like I'm really struggling with time to post on LinkedIn. I don't have a strategy you know all these core sort of pain points and it just means that you can then once these uh people are segmented you can throw email sequences together that aim to solve that core painoint. So if it's for example I don't have time we will do a three to five sequence that's like okay this is how

you start freeing up your time. this is an approach that you know will take less of your time and you can really kind of like handle their objections before them even like reaching out to you. Doing that will just significantly build trust and it will just make them far more likely to want to buy something from you because they've got all of this information for free. You know, they've

seen your social content, they've got that for free. They've then got this really tailored and personalized sequence which has helped them. they've got that for free. And then it's like it's almost a no-brainer to go with a paid because it's like if the free product is this good, how good is the paid product? If you do it in that approach and as long as you create a

product that is genuinely the best within your industry, I'm a big believer in quality. Like I really think that a lot of creators will be like, "Oh, I'm just going to try and monetize my audience. Let me just throw up a course on this without actually doing a research phase of like, these are all the courses. These are all the positioning of the courses. How can I

make mine levels above every other single product? >> Because at the end of the day, like people are gonna want to sign up for the thing that achieves the best results for them. >> Yeah. >> And and that's what we did with the accelerator. We were like, if we can see the the closest uh or the best LinkedIn

based cohort and just 10x the results of that, it's a no-brainer to choose ours over theirs because it's just better results. >> That's super interesting. So, in terms of your list and how you market the program, >> do you only send those email sequences to certain segments or does everyone get it?

>> Yes. >> Cuz that was what I was interested in in signing up to the newsletter. It's like, am I going to get this weekly newsletter from Chris? >> At what point is is there going to be some kind of sales sequence? Does everyone get a sales sequence or is it only certain people who click on certain things or

>> as I said because it was just us two building this business. We we're very much based like we're very small team and we just want to the goal is to scale the business using as little as Chris's time as possible and so we didn't actually have these like segmentation funnels set up. So what we were doing was um selling to the general newsletter. Now, we put so much time

into the newsletter, like a lot of research, like really making sure that it's like the best quality possible. Our kind of thing is through most of the year, you will get a free newsletter that drives significant value to you for free. Then we would do the odd mention within the newsletter itself, the general one, and be like, "Hey, uh, if you're interested in creator stuff, you

know, we've got this next cohort out. These are the results that we got for people. If you want to join, go ahead and click this link." But now as we're like trying to build and scale it, we have uh far more segmented emails. So we will probably be selling less to the the general newsletter because when you do sell unfortunately you get a mass um you know unsub kind of event going on. So

yeah we will be trying to protect the integrity of that and we are far more focused now on driving people towards a specific weight list and having these key segment areas where we'll be creating personalized sequence to drive them towards the accelerator. >> Interesting. So you would send a newsletter and it would say if you're interested in this join this weight list

and then the people who join that they get a bit more of a targeted sequence on on that because they're obviously interested in it. >> Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. So I think right now we have our current like followers. >> You put in your um name and your email and then we have like a segment thing that says um hey we've got the create accelerator coming out in January. It's

going to be our biggest discount ever. If you're interested click yes. They click yes. they get tagged and they're in that weight list area and then we can warm that audience up as well. >> A key part of our strategy has been webinars. >> Yes. So, >> so you have this like is it weekly webinar?

>> Yes. Yeah. So, when we're in like a sales cycle, it'll be um usually six to eight webinars and again this is like we really try and provide as much value in these in these webinars as possible. And so yeah, we will go super deep on a topic. Um, and we will try and basically build so much trust from our webinar itself. And we've studied like people like Russell Brunson and things like

that where we've seen like the perfect webinar and things like that. Ours is very much focused on educational content. We're like if we get thousands of people into this webinar, how can we give them as much value as possible? Yeah. and we will still try and sell them um towards the end of the call and we will say that up front of the call be like hey this is you know this is

primarily um for people looking to sign up to the creator accelerator but I am just going to give you loads of value you don't have to sign up it's for those that want to take LinkedIn seriously if you don't want that that's cool I'm going to give this insane amount of uh value away for free anyway so you're going to get that as well >> yeah and that's been like a very core

part of our strategy Chris is incredibly charismatic very good on these calls and he just has this like energy which is like super infectious and people get excited about it. So >> how do you not give away the source from the accelerator in those or or do you cuz you just don't care? >> You could probably tell there is so much depth and like it really is like a

science and so fortunately we can cover a lot of things and it also depends on the awareness stage of the person coming in as well. >> True. Yeah. So a lot of these webinars will have in our minds quite basic information but for 98% of people it's not basic. It's like super valuable. Yeah. >> Because

>> I guess even explaining the story like I wouldn't if I've just come across your post I I would have no idea who Chris is or >> what the hell's going on here. >> Exactly. And that's we will usually start most webinars with like a brief intro in introduction of who he is, the things that he's done as well. There is so much we can give away and it's

actually at the point now where we're like trying to scale the business more. We're trying to provide more free resources to people, more lead magnets and so we just want to give as much away as possible. And then we found with the accelerator, not only are you going to get this like insane amount of depth and like you know a large amount of educational content, module content that

you can learn from, but the most powerful thing we found is the accountability and is the community and network that you're building from it as well. >> Yeah. >> And so when we initially built the product, it was like, okay, the main thing that you're going to get here is the education. You're going to get then

get the transformation. But as we've kind of like done it throughout the last year or so, it's been like being in a space with 200 entrepreneurs who are making, you know, six, seven figures is more valuable. And if you're all pushing each other to like your very best limits, that is so valuable. And we've had like relations with people go into business together. We've had um yeah,

people like form groups who are like their mastermind groups and they just learn constantly together on different topics. And that community is something that I think is is probably one of the biggest reasons why people would join. >> How do you foster that? Do you have like breakout rooms where you get into small groups and like create an accountability group?

>> We so we played around with the idea of um breakout groups. We more focus on getting activity within the community within the circle. Within the onboarding process of coming onto the cohort, we're very much like this is for you. you should help people because if you help people you will go far. Like even for the first results, the people that got the best results were those that were in

the community. They were active. They were helping each other. They were like asking questions and so we very very much just encourage this like participation very early on. >> Mhm. >> And we link it towards the success and you know the more likelihood of your results are going to be good if you are active within the space.

>> Yeah. We will also incentivize it as in be like we have an award for someone who's like the most engaged within the community which I think is is super powerful because then people like oh if I'm I can win a legitimate prize here from just helping other people >> and having that me mentality very early on is is something that drives like a really beautiful community.

>> Yeah. I I used to work for a cohort business in COVID and I think we I think they did over 20 million a year in cohorts. >> Wow. Obviously, it was the best time ever for it because everyone's at home. But that was always one of the things that we found was you would market based on the information you're going to get and the master classes you're going to

get. But actually 50 60 70% of the value people got was as soon as they joined it was they realized ah it's the community and the other five 10 people that I I meet who I then grow with >> or go on to become friends with on this journey and become lifelong friends. but they don't realize that when they're signing up because they think think they're coming for the information.

>> Yes. >> I'm excited to share that this podcast is produced by me and my content agency 7X Content. We create incredible podcasts for world-class brands and creators. So, if you'd like to create something like this or you're thinking about taking your existing show to the next level, then you can reach out to us at the link in the description. I'd love

to hear from you. This has been absolutely fascinating. I'm curious if I wanted to get started now, what would you recommend the first steps I take in the next 30 60 days would be? >> What What's the main goal? >> I think it's driving leads to my business, but I'm also interested in, you know, I do a bit of coaching at the moment,

>> but I could see us doing more of that and and particularly in the the group style or the cohort style. I think that could be really interesting. We we already have interest in that and we don't really do much. We don't even talk about it. >> Okay. So, >> I mean, I think you guys have, from what I've seen anyway, like incredible free

resources, you know, from these podcasts, you get like lead magnets and things like that. I would make those incredibly visible. I would set up some sort of funnel based on on the you probably have it already, but if you don't, I would set that up. I would make sure your profile is optimized. I would do as much detailed research on LinkedIn of your ICP as possible. I become active

in the spaces they're active in. My belief is if if you grow, even if it's not growth within your ICP, if it's just general growth, I think that's a good strategy just because it's social proof. It's like, you know, you have this number of following, you know, you're credible within that space. And so, I would encourage you to grow on LinkedIn as well and go a little bit broader with

certain topics. Then you can really focus on you've got that growth, these new people coming in. What key topics can I talk about that are going to make them interested and build trust with them? And then I would think about how can I bring them over to the newsletter. I think deplatforming is like one of the most important things. Unfortunately on LinkedIn, you know, you can have a

million followers but still not reach a million people. So having their email is is so important. And if you're looking to build like a group coaching offer, I would think about people that you've coached already. That was like a super early quick win we did for like the MVP of the Crow Accelerator. Chris basically messaged all the people that he coached and was like, "Hey, do you have any

friends that would be interested in this sort of thing? Just be honest. share your journey and if it works then we can create a nice little group around it. And so I think the first one like the OG version was like 10 people. Some of those people became the fastest growing creators in the world. And so it' be the same thing. It'd be like how can I build an MVP where I have a small group of

people but I focus so much time and attention into it that they are guaranteed to have the best results out there and then that then becomes a strong part of your marketing for the first approach. And you can also that stage is a feedback gathering stage. So you want to gather as much feedback as possible on like how would this help? Would this help? Like yeah, can I offer

feedback in this way? You know, what would be beneficial to you? And then you can build a really clear offer. >> Once you have a really clear offer and you have the proof there already, it becomes so much easier to market. >> Yeah, I remember referrals. We used to get at least 30 fill 30% of a cohort on on that. Our ICPS were so dialed in um that people had amazing connections that

it was a great fit for. as well. A lot of people said that cohort based programs died after co like the world got drunk on them and then they got back to real life and they actually had things to do in the real world. Is your experience that they still work? >> Yes. I mean I have a lot of friends within within this this sort of area. I think we're very isolated as as

individuals nowadays. I think with social media and so forth. And so I think community is incredibly powerful. And I think the cohort can encourage that. And as long as you get people like within your first couple months experiencing that and then they're telling their friends about it, I think it's very hard for you not to get another round of people that are

interested because a lot of people crave that connection. A lot of people crave, you know, connection and results. And although it is hard work and we are very clear that it will be hard work the results that you will get from it will be will change your life in a certain way and if you have that clear transformation then you can get customers in.

>> I think the question a lot of people I know will be asking me or shouting at me right now is how do they find their Josh? So if if someone wants to find their Josh to run their LinkedIn or run their content like how did you hire your replacement? >> Uh good question. It's not easy, unfortunately. I wish it was because there are so many different people

sharing different types of advice from, you know, about LinkedIn. It means that there isn't necessarily many trained people on a way that works in multiple different industries. And so, I would personally say the best way of doing it is finding someone that's deeply ambitious, learning about it yourself completely, so you have a very clear understanding of how it all works, and

then training that person and spending a lot of time with that person. That's what Chris did with me. He taught me so much stuff. We're working together all the time to the point where you then become like you know exactly what they want to say, exactly what kind of content they want to create. Yeah. I would typically try and find ambitious people who are perhaps in current

positions that they don't feel like their potential is used. Uh and so whether it's like um certain like corporate businesses that have a very rigid structure, there's no potential for growth. Uh I think that's an interesting place to look at. um certain agencies as well that may be capped at at offering certain remuneration to people. That might be another um

interesting place. And I also think just like trying to find people on LinkedIn who have a little bit of an understanding of personal brand is is a good approach because they get the benefit of it and they understand if you have a big enough goal and mission that's super exciting and they can benefit from that journey then it's just such a huge incentive to join.

>> Cool. This has been so valuable, Josh. And I think we'll have to do a second one because it is so valuable, but I absolutely loved it and there's so much depth to it that we can get into another time. But yeah, thanks so much. You dropped so much game and uh yeah, loved your energy as well. So >> ah thanks so much, man. >> Yeah. No, it's it's been great fun.

>> I hope you enjoyed this conversation with Josh. If you did, I think you'll love my conversation with Caleb Rston, the former director of content for Alex and Laya Hormosi. He also worked with Gary Vee. It's an absolute masterass on building a personal brand. Make sure you're subscribed and go and watch that next. Uh I think you're gonna love it. Appreciate you and have a great week.

# How to Optimize Your Business for ChatGPT, Perplexity &amp; AI Search (GEO Tutorial)

I want you to type your industry into chat GPT. 
Just what's the best and then say your industry.   Does your brand even appear? For most businesses, 
the answer is no. Try it and comment below if you   show up. I want to see how many of you actually 
make the cut. Because here's what's really   going on. AI is quietly changing how people find 
information. Instead of clicking through 10 blue   links in Google, people are getting the answer 
directly in the SER. They're going to chatb AI   overviews and they're getting their answers. 
Let's test it. What's the best CRM software? Now, which marketing tools are worth it for 
customer management? The same brands appear   again and again and again, even though we ask 
completely different questions. That's how AI   search works. It keeps surfacing a handful of 
trusted sources. And if your company isn't one   of them, you're invisible in this new search 
ecosystem. According to Gartner, by 2026,  

25% of traditional search traffic is supposed 
to disappear and get replaced by AI generated   answers. Traditional SEO still matters, but 
it doesn't guarantee visibility anymore. So,   today I'm walking you through generative engine 
optimization or GEO, a seven-step system that   helps AI engines start citing your business, 
understanding your business, and articulating   you as the solution instead of your competitors. 
And if you want to see what this ship looks like   in action, HubSpot has a free guide that breaks 
down the early signs of AI powered search and   how to get ahead of it. I'll link it below so you 
can grab it before you start on your GEO audit.   All right, let's get into it. Step one, audit. 
You have to find out where you stand. Before you   can optimize for AI, you need to know where you're 
actually showing up. Here's what I want you to do.   Take your top 10 money keywords and I want you to 
ask AI the same way that your customers would. For  

example, if your keyword is marketing automation, 
try a question like, "What's the best marketing   automation software?" or "How do I choose the best 
marketing automation tool, you want to test these   in chat and perplexity or Google AI overviews?" 
And when you do this, make sure that you are using   a private setting so it's not biased to answer 
how you would think. Does your brand appear?   Which competitors are showing up in set? Which 
sources are the AI tools citing? You can also   tap into tools like Profound or Aerops to give you 
a sense of where they're going to get this data,   this information. You'll see the same pattern over 
and over again. Maybe it's G2, maybe it's Reddit,   maybe it's comparison pages that dominate these 
answers. This isn't a coincidence, folks. There   was a study done by authoritists which found that 
only a small fraction of the top ranking Google   pages actually appear in AI. In other words, 
what's winning in SEO today isn't automatically  

winning an AI search. So, pattern recognition 
is key. Understanding the way to structure your   content with datari, recently updated content is 
absolutely important. So take a screenshot of some   of those results. Put them in a save folder and 
monitor them time and time again. Now that you   know where to stand. The next step is simple. 
You need to make your content easier for the   AI to understand and of course site. So step two, 
restructuring. You need to write for how AI reads.   AI tools like CatchPT, Gemini, and Perplexity are 
built to summarize huge amounts of text fast. And   that means they don't reward the mystery and 
the fluff. They reward content that's clear,   structured, and gives direct answers upfront. 
So, you need to start your top performing blog   posts and landing pages with insights that align 
with the prompts that your customers and your   audience would be asking the LLM. Think of this 
as the three layer system for generative engine  

optimization. Start each page with a short answer 
explaining why it matters and back it up with data   and examples. This gives you authority. Here's a 
quick example. Before we had a long intro, story   and then the answer. After you'll see the answer 
first and story second. When you flip that order,   AI instantly knows what your page is all about and 
it can site it with confidence. But here's another   layer that most people miss. You need to make 
sure you're using the exact language that people   type into AI or say to their AI when you're 
restructuring. Think about the modifiers that   people use inside of an AI prompt. The same buying 
stage phrases that worked in SEO like best, top,   easy to use, cheap are the phrases that users 
are using when they're leveraging Chachi PT or   Plexity. These are your bottom offunnel prompt 
modifiers. Here's a few examples. Best solution,   top product, cheapest category, easy to use tools. 
So, make sure you have content like listicles and  

comparison pages that use these phrases. And 
yes, I know it might feel a little bit cringe   to put yourself as number one on the best XYZ 
software list, but guess what? AI doesn't care.   It just sees structured, trustworthy data and 
then it cites it. And that is your strategic   visibility. When you combine answer for structured 
with bottom ofunnel modifiers, you're giving the   AI exactly what it needs to feature your brand. So 
once your content is structured and it's visible,   the next question is why would AI choose to 
site you over someone else? Let's dive into it.   Step three, authority. You want to build signals 
that AI trusts. You need to make AI trust you   enough to site your content. Let's start with 
schema markup. Your content's digital ID card.   Schema helps AI understand who wrote it, when it 
was published, and who it belongs to. You should   also tap into metadata as well. You can use a free 
tool like Google structured data markup helper to  

make this really easy. Select a data type such as 
articles or questions and answer page. Then paste   your HTML source or public URL into the tool and 
click start tagging. Highlight your headline and   mark it as the title, author name as author, 
publish date as date published, and your main   article text as article body. For FAQs, highlight 
each question and tag them properly. Click create   HTML to generate the JSON LD markup. Copy the code 
and paste the header section of your page. Then   you want to test your markup. Use Google's rich 
results test to confirm that it's valid and see   how it appears in the search results. If you've 
done this, congrats. You're already ahead of   90% of the site still guessing how AI reads their 
content. Next, build external validation. You want   to get your website listed where AI is already 
looking to for credibility. Whether it's Reddit,   YouTube, Capter, Trust Pilot, Yelp, these review 
sites and UGC sites are AI's reference library.  

Publish original research is also a great way to 
establish authority. Buzz Sumo found that research   earns three times more citations than other 
content. Even small surveys or benchmark reports   can help you have more recurring mentions in the 
citations. Finally, don't be afraid of reaching   out to reporters and journalists to get you 
published in third parties, whether that's through   affiliate marketing or simply using a tool like 
Harrow. This is a great way for you to establish   credibility to show that you're verified, that 
you're credible, and that you can be trusted.   Now, up to now, you've made your content very 
trustworthy. You've made it structured. Now,   it's time to make sure AI actually finds 
it. But first, if you're still watching,   you're officially in the top 1% of marketers who 
care about future proofing their work. So, comment   below. Still here, because I want to know what 
type of people start what they finish. Step four,  

get technical. Optimize for AI crawlers. Think of 
this as your website's infrastructure checkout.   The same principles as SEO, but turned into AI 
discovery oriented. If AI can reach your content   faster, it's going to recommend you faster. Start 
with a quick technical checkup because even though   AI discovery feels new, the fundamentals are 
still key. Here's a simple checklist that you   can run through. First, speed. Your site should 
load in under 2 seconds. Structure. Make sure your   layout's mobile friendly, your headers are in 
order, and your URLs are clean. Signals. Add   schema markup in all text so AI and accessibility 
tools can actually read what's on your page. Next,   leverage FAQ schema wherever it fits. Mstone 
research found that 60% of AI responses come   from FAQ structured content. So, make sure that 
you have these sections on your site and they're   tagged correctly. A lot of folks also like 
to emphasize that content freshness is a key  

signal for AI models updating content regularly 
and can increase your chances of being cited.   This came directly from search engine. Finally, 
test everything using Google's rich result test   and the schema.org validator. If your schema 
is valid, then it's readable. When your site   is technically sound and fast, you remove every 
barrier that exists between your content and the   AI models being able to index it and use it as a 
part of their systems. Once your site is crawable,   let's build a system that scales everything that 
you've just done. Step five, workflows. Scale your   GEO content production. This step is all about 
building a system that you can hand off to your   team or your future self so every new piece 
follows the same winning formula. Here's your   GEO content template. One, direct answers. Your 
headline needs to clearly state the main query   that you're answering and keep it short and sweet. 
Two, a quick answer. With like 50 words or so,  

summarize the key takeaways up at the top of your 
piece. Three, data visualization or a table. You   want to incorporate that directly in your piece 
immediately after the intro. Four, a methodology   section. You want to have a section that breaks 
down the methods, the analysis, and what you did   to come up with the various insights shared on 
the page. Five, provide a detailed analysis. You   need to go above and beyond into the insights and 
takeaways that you are providing your reader. Six,   an FAQ section with schema. Mark questions and 
answers very clearly for AI visibility. Seven,   the last updated date. You want to show the 
freshness on every page. Show exactly when this   piece just got updated. Once you've built a few of 
these, use this pre-publication checklist before   you hit publish. Is there a direct answer in the 
first 50 words? Is data or a chart included within   the first 200 words? Are there credible sources 
and citations made throughout? Are the author's  

credentials and schema visible, clickable, and 
very much accessible? Is it mobile friendly? Is   the load time fast? Make sure that you use this 
template to turn every single post into a GEO   ready asset that AI can understand, trust, and 
site consistently. Build this workflow once and   you'll scale AI visibility on autopilot. Now, 
let's make sure that your GEO ready content is   actually showing up where it matters the most. 
Step six, tracking. Monitor your AI visibility.   I want you to run a weekly visibility audit. Test 
your top 20 prompts across chat GPT, Perplexity,   Google's AI overviews. And again, you can use 
tools like Profound or Aerops to make this smooth.   Keep everything in a simple tracker like you see 
here. Log what you see. Was your brand mentioned?   Which competitors showed up? Which sources did the 
AI site? You'll start to see patterns fast. Which   platforms site you, which skip you, and where 
competitors dominate? Once you have the data,  

use this GEO prioritization matrix. High value 
plus low AI visibility equals immediate priority.   High traffic plus high visibility. Maintain and 
update. Low traffic and high visibility means   analyze why and adapt. The goal is to turn AI 
tracking into a habit. Because once you see the   patterns, you can optimize faster any algorithm 
chase. Once you've nailed these six steps, there's   still room to grow. Let's dive into it. Step 
seven, advanced tactics. Go beyond the basics.   Here are four tactical strategies that will help 
you push your brand above the competition in the   AI answers. First, take a contrarian angle to your 
content. Instead of just writing the best tools,   show people exactly why organizations switch 
and back it up with research and data. Two,   real-time updates. Add a latest update sections 
on a regular basis. Actually create a system   where you're constantly updating content 24 hours 
a day on non-stop. Three, multiplatform authority.  

Republish snippets and insights to LinkedIn, 
to Reddit, to GitHub, to YouTube, to Quora. AI   engines use these platforms to decide who to site, 
and it uses comments to inform the responses in   the LLM. Four, a Wikipedia strategy. You want to 
tap in to Wikipedia because it is oftentimes being   cited. It is one of AI's most trusted data sets. 
So, a credible edit can have outsized impact.   These tactics might take a bit more effort. They 
might even require more budget and scope, but they   create long-term authority that AI recognizes and 
uses across platforms. Now, let's turn it into a   30-day action plan that you can follow and execute 
immediately. Week one, audit and test keywords.   You're going to test your top 20 keywords 
across chatt, perplexity, Google AI overviews,   etc. You want to note where your brand does and 
doesn't show up. Non-branded prompts are super   important here. That's your starting point. Week 
two, restructure and schema optimization. Pick  

your top performing pages that are being cited 
and apply that three layer system. Then tag FAQs   using schema so AI engines can read them clearly. 
Week three, build authority and technical setup.   Publish new FAQ pages. Refresh old data. Make sure 
your author pages are up to date. Fix any speed   or mobile issues. Submit your site map so AI and 
Google can recall them faster. Week four, workflow   and tracking. Build your GEO content template and 
start your weekly tracking log. Every week, check   to see which AI tools are sending your content or 
what other domains it's sending so you can reach   out and collaborate with them. Stick with this 
for 30 days. You'll start seeing early signals   of AI visibility, citations, mentions, and traffic 
from platforms that never existed in traditional   SEO. The sooner you start, the sooner AI is going 
to start recognizing you as the authority. Folks,   GEO isn't replacing SEO. It's the evolution of 
it. The brands winning aren't always the biggest.  

They're the ones that are adapting the fastest. If 
you want to start optimizing for how AI actually   finds sites information right now, then well done. 
You're already ahead of 90% of your competitors.   If you want to go deeper, grab HubSpot's

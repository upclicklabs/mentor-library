# Copy These NEW Landing Pages to 3x Your Leads

Each of these landing pages are converting visitors to leads at 15% or higher, and they're 100% yours to steal for yourself. But before you just start copying, you need to understand why these pages work overtime for their businesses, while most just crash and burn. After building and testing over 300 landing pages for just about every type of service business you can

imagine, I can tell you it's not because they're ugly. It's not because they're missing some fancy feature. and it's definitely not because they're using the wrong software. The real difference comes down to understanding exactly what makes people take action. In this video, I'm going to show you three proven landing page templates that you can copy section by section to dramatically boost

your conversions. the exact psychological principles that make people say yes to your offer instead of clicking away and the biggest mistakes that are secretly killing your landing page conversions right now, including one that 90% of businesses make without even realizing it. When you get this right, you can take a landing page from converting 2 to 3% of visitors to 15% or

higher. That's the difference between losing money on ads and making a serious profit. But before we dive into these templates, we need to talk about something that happened in my weekly small groupoup coaching call last week. So, one of my students, he's a realtor in Poland. He brought this landing page to me that he'd been running Google ads to. He was frustrated because he'd

gotten 200 clicks that he paid for, but zero conversions. Not a single person filled out his form. Now, when I looked at his page, it actually looked really nice and professional. Clean design, good photos, the whole nine yards. But that is kind of the problem. He was so focused on making it look good that he completely missed what actually makes people convert. And this is the perfect

example to show you what I mean. Because we're going to transform this non-converting page into one that could be worth millions to his business. Cuz here's what most people don't get. About 90% of landing pages fail because they start with a weak offer. Because if you're not offering something people can get fired up about, nothing else we do on the page is really going to matter.

And this guy's offer just wasn't it, right? We'll help you sell your property without stress and paperwork. I mean, it sounds nice, but it's just not enough to make me want to choose this realtor over any of the other ones out there. It's a pretty basic promise that literally any realtor should make. It's kind of like a restaurant saying, you know, we'll make you some food so you don't have to cook.

doesn't really get you excited, does it? This should really be positioning them as the better choice compared to other realtor. So, what do people really want in a realtor? You know, someone who's going to get them the most money and get it sold fast, right? Here's what's really going on. So, by the time people get to this page through a Google ad, they already know that they need a good

realtor. That means they're what we call solution aware. Let me explain this because it's super important. So there are five stages of customer awareness. At the top, you have people who are completely unaware. They don't even know they have a problem yet. And at the bottom, you have people who are most aware. They know everything and they're ready to buy. This realtor's clients are

right in the middle, right? They're solution aware. They know they have to hire a realtor. What they don't know yet is which specific realtor they should go with. So this landing page just needs to move them to the next stage which is product aare meaning they know this realtor is the one they want to go with. So now let's completely reimagine this page starting with this top section. So

this is what some people call above the fold but I just call it the hero section. So here's the new offer that I came up with that goes way beyond just you know we'll sell your house without stress. It's get a record- setting price for your home in 30 days or we'll wave our commission. Now, that's a real offer that would get people interested. It's specific, it's bold, and it puts their

money where their mouth is. Okay, so now let's take a look at the other parts of the hero section. So, first we have what we call the eyebrow copy up here. Um, that's just basically where we call out the ideal customer. Then, of course, we have the headline. We already went over that. That highlights the offer. Then we have our subheading here which goes deeper into what they actually offer and

the benefits of it. And next we have the call to action button. So I decided to go for an apply call to action button which is great for implying exclusivity. Now that won't always work especially if you're selling a product. But if you're a service business, especially if what you offer is kind of on the upper end of the market and you want to maybe weed some people out, this apply kind of

language can work really well for that. Then I added this bit here, only a few openings left to create some additional urgency. And then beneath we have some social proof, which lets people know that it's safe to work with us because we've done this for lots of other people before and we've gotten them good results. This right here removes a lot of the hesitation that people might have

about actually clicking the button. Okay, so moving down the page, what we have next here is a section highlighting the benefits of the offer. In this case, we have some stats to share, which is really powerful if you have them. These could be results, outcomes, anything that makes the offer stand out from your competition. And you really want to go beyond saying things like, you know,

great customer service or just basic stuff like that. These should really make the reader take notice and lean forward. Okay, next up, I really wanted to promote these testimonials prominently. Since the people are coming to this page are already solution aware, we don't really need to waste a lot of time with a long sales letter section where we explain the problem. You know,

once they know the general solution, which is to hire the right realtor, we just want to get them to choose this realtor specifically. And nothing works better than real stories from real customers. Now, I want you to notice I've included photos of each of the clients. This helps a lot just by showing that there these people are willing to stand behind their words

publicly. It's a psychological thing, but it just makes it feel a lot more believable than if they seemed anonymous. Okay, next section. So, people may not always know how the offer actually works. So, we want to make it easy to understand with a simple three-step process section. So, step one is always going to be the same as the call to action. In this case, apply to

work with us. Step two is where all your actual work happens. Then, step three is the happy ending where their house is sold, they made money, and it was all quick and painless. So, the point here isn't to actually show every single step that you go through. It's to make it look this easy for your customer, right? While pointing them in the right direction here to get going. Okay. Next,

moving along, I decided to put even more social proof. So, in this case, um it's showing recent home sales and their prices, including little notes like, you know, $70,000 over asking or 12 offers. Now, this is to show proof that this actually works. So, if you're not a realtor, you can just show even more testimonials or some kind of version of this that applies to your offer with

real stats and numbers. Okay. Next up, we have a 10 reasons why section. So, I love this because these aren't just 10 random reasons, right? These are based on research of the actual decision-making criteria of your ideal customer. And you can do this through interviews or what I would recommend these days, I actually just use Chad GBT to find this kind of thing for me in

less than 10 minutes using their deep research mode. So you just find that decision-making criteria. Then you kind of spin those into these 10 reasons. But people may still have doubts about whether this offer is truly any better than what they can get from other realtor. And that's why I like this comparison section so much. So, it directly compares what this offer is

going to give you above and beyond what you can expect to get anywhere else. You just want to really make sure here that each line is comparing apples to apples, not just two random lists of why you're good and why why they're bad, right? So, see how each line here is talking about the same topic, drawing a really specific comparison. That's what you want. Okay. Next, we have a are we right

for you section. So, this works great because it directly answers the only real question they have at this point. Is this right for me? Honestly, there are tons of ways to do this, but I absolutely love this treatment that I picked up for my friend Alicia Conlin. Shout out to her channel. This layout just does a really good job of painting these really clear and specific

scenarios that your page visitors might find themselves in. Then, it points to a testimonial that matches that exact scenario. It's so clean and direct that it just works amazingly well. And then you just want to end it with a really clear call to action section with the same button as we had before up top. So this page works great if your visitors are solution aware. But what if they're

only problem aware? Remember that means they know they have a problem. They don't know what the solution is yet. In that case, you just want to add another section. We call it the sales letter section right between the benefits bar here and the testimonials. Now, this sales letter section is just going to present the problem and really drive it home in a few paragraphs of text. Or you

can always use this next landing page concept that's even more clever in what it does. So, when people are problem aware, you want to attract them with the problem itself. So, this landing page is basically a sales pitch for your offer. cleverly disguised as an article. I've seen this called an advertorial. I've seen it called a pre-sell article. But whatever you call it, this specific type

of landing page can boost your conversion rates by up to 79%. Data for more than 41,000 landing pages shows that the average conversion rate on a typical landing page is about 6.6%, but with just the right pre-sell alone, you can expect to double that. So, this works great with Google ads where people are, you know, searching for their problem like my dog won't stop barking

or I'm not getting any patients at my dental practice. In this case, it's my toddler won't sleep through the night. And the reason this works so well with ads is that pre-sale pages have been shown to get 3.5% click-through rates from ads versus the typical 2% for, you know, those more direct sales pages. In other words, a page like this that promises information they can use today

is a way easier cell to get people to click on in the first place than a page that just promises to sell them something. So, this also works great with social media ads like on Facebook or Instagram. You can even get people to an article like this from Tik Tok or, you know, if you're a B2B business, LinkedIn would work great, too. Okay, so now I want to go through this page

because it's not just an article. There's a whole lot more happening underneath the hood. Right at the top, you're going to notice this headline is not about the offer itself. It's just a well-written article title. And Chad GBT can really help you out here. So, ideally, it should show a result that you get in a short time frame without having to, you know, do something

negative. So, this one says, "How I got my toddler sleeping 11 hours a night in just seven days without cry it out," which is apparently a typical method that a lot of parents just don't want to use. Then, we just have a really short description of what's coming in the article, especially what they'll be able to accomplish after they read it. Then, we have the author by line um with some

authority building. In this case, she is a certified pediatric sleep consultant. And now the layout here isn't what's important. It can look like any blog header that you've ever seen as long as it has these elements. And a photo is nice to have too. It just helps tell the story visually and helps keep people more interested in reading further. So getting into the article itself here,

you always want to start with the problem that your customers dealing with right now. So this case we have three months ago. I was sitting in my kitchen holding my crying 2-year-old for the fourth time that night. My husband has passed out on the couch. Lucky him. And I was running on maybe two hours of sleep again. That one sentence does a great job of bringing up the problem and

making it feel real enough to keep the reader, you know, nodding along like, "Yep, that's exactly where I am right now, too." Then this next bit establishes your authority as the author so that the reader knows this is going to be some kind of expert solution. As a pediatric sleep consultant, I help families with this exact problem every single day. Then we get into, you know,

why what you've already tried probably uh didn't work. And this is great because it shifts the blame off of the reader, which makes them feel like you're on their side. You know, it's not them, they just haven't found the right thing yet. This is a classic sales copyrightiting technique for a reason. And notice how we include photos inside the article here and there just to keep

them interested and moving down the page. If this were all just text, people would get bored really easily. And AI image tools like Mjourney can make anything you need in just a few seconds. Um, these images were all made uh using Mjourney. In fact, then we get into the expert secrets or tips. So the trick here is to give them a taste of the DIY version without giving them absolutely

everything, right? You just want them to see that you know what you're talking about, but they may still have some questions. Now, here is where we smoothly transition from the DIY version to the paid offer. So, I call this the content to offer bridge. It basically says something like, look, these steps do work, but what do you do if you can't get them working yourself? That's where

I come in. Then, we introduce the solution, right? Our sleep consultant, Sarah. And this last sentence here states exactly what the offer is. It's a personalized two-eek program where I work with you directly to solve your toddler's sleep challenges. We've got a nice photo of her right here building trust with her and her kids so we know she knows what she's talking about. Then

we formally introduce the offer complete with what it includes, followed by a testimonial section again with real customer photos and a short statement of how many people that she's helped and exactly what the results were. Then we have that three-step section and the 10 reasons why section. We already talked about these in the last landing page example, so I won't go into it again

here, but again, these reasons should be based on the research you do about ex what your ideal customer actually cares about before saying yes to an offer like this. Then you just reverse engineer their decision making criteria into these 10 reasons. Then we have our call to action section that really eases them into it, saying that this is a no pressure starting point to just remove

any hesitation. Then we have a short money back guarantee section. Now, this does an amazing job of just reversing the risk and making people feel like they're not taking a leap without a safety net here, right? If it doesn't work, they can get their money back. It just makes it much easier for people to say yes. And in my experience, very few of them ever actually take you up on the

money back part unless your offer really just isn't that good. And I know that's not the case with you. So, um, anyway, next we have the FAQ section specifically to address those last minute objections that people might have uh before really feeling confident about moving forward. And then we follow that up with a final call to action section that reiterates the offer and what

they're going to lose if they don't take action. So that is super powerful because they're going through the problem right now. The last thing they want is to stay stuck in that pain. Okay, next up we have a completely different landing page with a very different purpose. Sometimes the best offer that you can make as a business is a free piece of valuable content

designed to build your email list. Because believe it or not, email is still the single best marketing channel for sales. And even if you don't personally think sales emails work on you, I get comments like that all the time. The stats don't lie. Email marketing generates 174% more total conversions than social media marketing. And for every dollar you put into email

marketing, businesses typically get about 36 to $44 back in return. But to get those email addresses to you and market to in the first place, you need a landing page designed to sell your free content, aka your lead magnet. So, let's look at what's working really well right now. Okay, so this is my own landing page for my free masterclass training video. I primarily get people here

directly from YouTube, but I've also run ads to it in the past. Um, YouTube ads, Instagram ads. I could run Google ads to it if I wanted to. There are lots of ways that you can get people over to a page like this. And diving into my numbers here, this puts about 30 to 40 new people on my list almost every single day. And it converts at about 62%. And a typical page like this that

gets warm traffic to it like I do can usually converts it closer to 45 to 50%. So this one's actually doing a really good job for me. And as you can see, it is very simple. I start just by letting people know what it is. It's a free video master class. Then we have the title, which should be very outcomebased, right? Not just promising what you'll learn, but rather what it's

going to do for you. In this case, it's going to generate a website that sells your services for you. Then we've got a sub headline that just, you know, gives a little bit more context, followed by a more detailed description that dives a little deeper into the promise of the lead magnet. And again, we really want this to be based on results and outcomes, not just, you know, this is

what you're going to learn. It's really important to know that people don't sign up to learn stuff or for information. They sign up for things like this to achieve some kind of a transformation, you know, cuz people can learn for free on YouTube or podcasts without giving over their email. So, you really have to make it sound extra special. And we do that by painting that after picture. you

know, we say it becomes your hardest working salesperson. Um, turn your website into a client attraction machine that works for you around the clock. Then we just have a really super simple form that only asks for their first name so that we can customize the emails that we send and their email address. That's it. And the call to action button that emphasizes what they get, not just, you

know, submit or something generic like that. Okay. Next, we have that benefits bar that we saw earlier. Now, in this case, I was able to include real numbers, which is gold if you can. It just shows in a few really quick hits. Why this solution? How is it better than other things that you might try? And since this page is pulling in people from a few different awareness levels, I

decided I wanted to include a really short sales letter section. Remember, I brought that up before. Here's kind of an example of that. It just paints the picture of the problem that they have, which is a lack of clients due to a website that's not properly optimized. And then I have these bullets that are meant to really kind of paint the picture of the symptoms of the problem.

And this section doesn't really need to be much longer than this. Um, especially when we're talking about a free offer. You know, generally speaking, the higher price something is, the more you need to kind of talk them into it with a longer version of a section like this. But, you know, in our case here, free lead magnet, this length is perfect. Then we have a simple invitation bar where I

just say, "Join me here." Followed by a really clever section um that uses a lot of curiosity and what we call open loops to make people think, wait, there's an actual, you know, framework for that and whoa, what are the three things not to include on my website? And do I have them on mine? Open loops are basically unfinished thoughts that create that mental tension, right? So, your brain

naturally wants to close the loop. So, these are all just teasing what they'll learn in the video in a way that makes them super curious to find out the answer, which leads to more signups. Then, I've just got a really direct call to action bar, then a row of testimonials from real people who have already been through the training. So, what you want here ideally is to hit on

a few different angles. You know, maybe one's about the actual results they got. one emphasizes uh how much easier this made it or how much faster, right? Because different people have different reasons uh for wanting the same thing. Then we do have a little about me section. Um I find that this helps establish some quick authority points, especially if people aren't coming in

warm. Like if you're running social media ads or something, uh they probably would want to know why they should even be listening to you. Now, I admit this is probably a bit long, especially when the people coming here are warmer traffic, so part of me wants to shorten it up, but as I said, this page is actually working really well for me. So, I'm probably just going to leave it

alone. Then, I just added another row of testimonials because it's always good to have as much social proof as we can. Then, a very simple final call to action block. So, whichever one of these landing pages you want to steal for your own business, all that's missing now is the step-by-step part, right? How do you actually make the page? Well, I've got you covered in this start to finish

tutorial where you'll see how to turn your offer into the perfect landing page so that it's live and online in just about an hour. So, click here for that, including a special discount that I've worked out with my favorite web host so you can get started for just a few bucks. So, click here and let's get you all set

# How do you improve speed and decrease costs with prompt caching?

Let's talk a little bit about prompt caching. It's a feature that we've released relatively recently, leads to tremendous cost savings. We'd just love to know more, especially with customers that you've worked with where this is a good fit and how they can start leveraging this.

Yeah, for sure. So prompt caching is a feature we can add on top of our models. So Anthropic, we're training models, but we can also build things on top of the models to make them faster, more efficient. And prompt caching is a particularly exciting one.

And so the idea with prompt caching is if you have a prompt that you're running, let's say you have a workflow, I don't know, you're labeling a bunch of data, you're doing a big backfill, something like this, and you have a prompt and it has a bunch of examples in it, and then just a little bit at the end that's like categorized as email for me, something like that. What prompt caching lets you do is the start of the prompts that is fixed, you can actually kind of cache that portion. One, it makes your queries run quite a bit faster. And two, because we're doing less calculations, there's less compute, there's actually a meaningful cost savings that we pass on to our developers.

And so what this means is that the prompts that you cache or the input tokens that you cache, you get a nice 90% discount and all of a sudden your prompts run quite a bit faster.

And I've heard a bit from folks internally that prompt caching also allows for the ability to make your first initial prompt much larger, things like adding more examples and so on. What else can you potentially unlock with prompt caching?

Yeah, that's a great point. So once you have prompt caching, all of a sudden you might start doing things with your prompt that you wouldn't have considered before. And the big one is now you could add 20, 50, a hundred more examples to your prompt, which might help with task accuracy. And you won't incur the cost of doing that because now all those are cached and you are getting responses in the same, about the same amount of time, and you're still paying about the same price.

That sounds fantastic. So why not cache everything? That's a good question. That might not be practical. So for sure, this doesn't make sense for every prompt. Certainly there's workflows out there where, you know, the content that you're putting into the prompt is wildly different. A lot of RAG use cases come to mind where you might be pulling in, depending on, you know, what the end user is asking for, different kind of cuts of your knowledge base, things like that. It might not make sense for every workflow.

So dynamic data is really where this is gonna not work as well. Right. We're gonna be thinking about prompts where there's just this large fixed amount of text that you're passing into the model every time.

Got it. And are there considerations to think about between prompt caching and different models like Haiku or Sonnet? That's a good point. For instance, you could imagine you might be able to use prompt caching with a model like Sonnet and all of a sudden get some of those nice cost and latency characteristics that you might otherwise have had to, like, use Haiku for right? On top of that, you know, if you're able to use prompt caching with Sonnet, perhaps on like a more absolute basis, you know, being able — Sonnet is slower, more expensive, the 90%, you know, the discounts and the latency boost might matter a little more than on a model like Haiku, which is already very fast, very cheap.

So prompt caching is gonna save a tremendous amount and message batching, also another feature that we recently released can also help with cost savings. Let's talk about that for a little bit for some of the wins that customers can get. Can you walk me through that feature and that might be a good use case for it?

So that's another feature that we recently released that sits on top of the models. And the idea here is you can pass a bunch of prompts to us at one time and say, hey, I don't totally care when you get the responses back to me, Anthropic, do it when it makes sense. And then we, over the course of 24 hours, usually much faster than that, process those prompts and return them to the user. And because of that, we can pass on a 50% discount.

And you can use prompt caching and batching together to really save. Is that accurate? You can, yes. Wow. So considering those with an even smaller model, especially one like 3.5 Haiku that has quite a bit of intelligence, there are tremendous cost savings you could see here. Absolutely.

That's fantastic. And for folks that wanna get started with using prompt caching, message batching and so on, where would you recommend they go? I would recommend they go to the Anthropic docs. We have great documentation for all these features. Excellent. I know a lot of folks on your team also have been working on cookbooks and really good use cases as well. So a lot of good resources. Yeah, you're gonna see docs, you're gonna see code, examples, everything you need to get started. Awesome.

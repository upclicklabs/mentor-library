# Shopify_AEO for Ecommerce: How To Drive Traffic To Your Store From AI

**By Kyle Risley, Senior SEO Lead at Shopify**

## Overview

As AI answer engines like ChatGPT gain prominence, ecommerce businesses face a new challenge: optimizing for AI-powered search results rather than traditional keyword rankings. This shift requires understanding how AI discovers and recommends products.

## How AI Search Engines Work

Answer engines employ "query fan-out," transforming a single user query into multiple related questions to gather comprehensive information. For instance, a query about affordable quality bed sheets might expand into three subtopics: high-quality sheets under $50, affordable sets with good reviews, and best budget cotton sheets.

This process relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which combines the AI model's training data with live internet searches. The system synthesizes results to produce conversational answers while citing sources.

## How AI Understands Brands

Two mechanisms influence brand visibility in AI responses:

**Training Data:** Establishes baseline knowledge and brand reputation. Brands frequently appearing in training materials gain recognition as authoritative.

**RAG (Real-time Data):** Fetches current information like pricing, stock levels, and recent reviews from live web searches, enabling AI to provide up-to-date recommendations.

## Seven Strategies to Drive AI Traffic

### 1. Establish Core KPIs
Track which pages generate AI referral traffic and conversion rates. Shopify merchants can filter Analytics reports by "ChatGPT" under the Referrer name to benchmark performance against other channels.

### 2. Monitor AI Visibility
Implement prompt tracking—the AI equivalent of keyword tracking. Tools like Ahrefs Brand Radar or Profound allow monitoring of custom prompts. Study which publications consistently appear in AI citations within your niche.

### 3. Master Product Citability
Structure product pages with clear, factual details about dimensions, materials, and specifications. Move beyond marketing copy to database-like clarity that AI systems prefer. Include certifications, care instructions, and comprehensive feature lists.

### 4. Create Pre-Purchase Tools
Build interactive tools that AI cannot easily replicate—like Behr's paint visualizer. These resources drive clicks from answer engines to your site, addressing the "zero-click" search concern.

### 5. Become a Primary Source
Publish original research to establish authority. When brands conduct proprietary studies and secure citations in authoritative publications (particularly .gov or .edu sites), AI systems recognize them as trusted sources.

### 6. Secure Mentions in Trusted Publications
Run PR campaigns targeting publications frequently cited by answer engines. Alternatively, launch affiliate programs encouraging reviewers to feature your products directly.

### 7. Measure Progress
Beyond traffic metrics, track revenue attributed to AI sources and compare conversion rates against other channels. Monitor "share of voice" for relevant brand mentions across AI-tracked prompts.

## Key Takeaway

The absolute first step is to establish a baseline for which pages on your site are earning the most traffic from AI search. Success requires maintaining SEO fundamentals while building authentic brand authority that resonates across both training data and real-time search results.

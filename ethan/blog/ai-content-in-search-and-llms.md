# How Does AI-Generated Content Perform in Search and Answer Engines?

## Key Takeaways

- Companies publish millions of AI-generated articles targeting Google Search and answer engines like ChatGPT, though effectiveness claims lack substantiation
- Actual performance data shows human-written content dominates search and LLM citations
- AI-assisted content with significant human editing wasn't evaluated and may show different results

## Main Findings

### Prevalence in Search and Answer Engines

**Google Search**: 86% of articles ranking in Google Search are written by humans, and only 14% are generated using AI.

**ChatGPT**: 82% of cited articles are written by humans, and only 18% of cited articles are generated using AI.

**Perplexity**: 82% of cited articles are written by humans, and only 18% are generated using AI.

### Ranking Performance

When AI-generated content appears in Google Search, it underperforms human-written articles:
- Only 7% of top-ranking articles are AI-generated
- AI content concentrates beyond the tenth position
- Statistical testing confirms human articles rank higher (p < 1e-6)

### Category Breakdown

AI-generated content concentration varies significantly:
- **Lowest**: Food (4.5%), News (4.7%), Travel (6.5%)
- **Highest**: Productivity (14.1%), Crypto (13.3%), Tech (10.8%)

## Methodology Notes

The study analyzed 31,493 keywords across 10 categories using Surfer's AI detector with 4.2% false positive and 0.6% false negative rates.

## Important Caveat

The research notes that AI-assisted content with heavy human editing wasn't evaluated and may be an effective strategy for driving search visibility.

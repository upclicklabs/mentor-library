# Contribute to MCP on GitHub

## Model Context Protocol Organization Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. This initiative helps developers connect artificial intelligence systems with the external resources and capabilities they need to function effectively.

## Key Resources

The organization maintains comprehensive documentation at modelcontextprotocol.io, including a detailed specification and protocol guidelines. Developers can access an official SDK in ten programming languages: TypeScript, Python, Java, Kotlin, C#, Go, PHP, Ruby, Rust, and Swift.

## Featured Projects

The most prominent repositories include:

- **servers** (79k stars): A collection of maintained Model Context Protocol implementations across multiple languages
- **python-sdk** (21.7k stars): The official Python implementation for building MCP-compatible applications
- **typescript-sdk** (11.6k stars): The TypeScript version serving similar functionality
- **inspector** (8.7k stars): A visual testing tool developers use to validate MCP server behavior
- **csharp-sdk** (3.9k stars): The C# implementation developed collaboratively with Microsoft

## Community Engagement

The organization operates under The Linux Foundation's umbrella as an open-source initiative welcoming community contributions. Active discussions occur in their community forum, and the project maintains transparent development practices through its GitHub presence with over 43,000 followers.

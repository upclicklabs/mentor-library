# Prompt Generator

The prompt generator is compatible with all Claude models, including those with extended thinking capabilities.

Sometimes, the hardest part of using an AI model is figuring out how to prompt it effectively. To help with this, a prompt generation tool is available that guides Claude to generate high-quality prompt templates tailored to your specific tasks. These templates follow many prompt engineering best practices.

The prompt generator is particularly useful as a tool for solving the "blank page problem" to give you a jumping-off point for further testing and iteration.

The prompt generator is available directly on the Anthropic Console dashboard.

For those interested in analyzing the underlying prompt and architecture, a prompt generator Google Colab notebook is available where you can run the code to have Claude construct prompts on your behalf. Note that an API key is required to run the Colab notebook.

# Give me 46 minutes and I'll 10x Your LinkedIn Reach (Copy this Strategy)

Two years ago, I was struggling to break past 20,000 followers on LinkedIn. I was frustrated. I was close to giving up. And time and time again, I couldn't work it out. Today, I have over a million followers, creating millions a year across a portfolio of businesses, and a strategy that really can be repeated by anyone willing to put in the work. So, how did I do it? First, this did not

happen quickly. I think it's been a culmination of over a decade of hard work and building businesses, 2 and 1/2 years of building my personal brand. However, if I was to start again, this is what I do. Let me walk you through my exact framework that I use to go from struggling to get traffic through to being the most viewed creator on LinkedIn. Sometimes above Barack Obama

and Bill Gates. And before I tell you the topics I'm covering, I don't think I am the most influential person on LinkedIn. However, I do think it is interesting that a relatively ordinary business person can get themselves into a position where they have an extraordinary amount of views and attention on their business. And that is the thing as an entrepreneur I'm

fascinated by is why more entrepreneurs aren't building in public because you get so much attention and attraction towards your business. In this video, we will be going through five separate topics. The first is how to set up your LinkedIn page as a landing page. So, how do you set up the page? How does it convert? Number two, we're going to be talking about the five proven LinkedIn

posts that will help you grow followers and get clients. Number three, I'm going to focus on what pre-validated content actually is and how you can use it so you never have a day where you don't know what to post. Number four, we're going to talk through how to actually sell on LinkedIn. I'm going to be working you through the different methodologies to actually sell to

customers, how to segment customers, and how to keep customers for years to come. And number five, which really is a bonus section, and if you subscribe to the channel and sign up to the newsletter, I will send you this sheet. It is the 2025 algorithm report, which we released only a few days ago that shows you the exact hacks, the exact formats, and the exact tricks that you need to get your content

to perform and how to grow a following. So, ladies and gentlemen, let's get into it. So, as you can see on this sheet, for my profile picture, I used a high-quality headsh shot that I took that was approachable. It was credible. For the banner, I chose bold and simple visuals that reflect my brand's value, and it linked to my newsletter, which is something I'll talk a lot about later,

but the newsletter became the most important thing for the business. So, after this, you've got your headline and your about section. And your headline is so important as it appears under every single post and every single comment that you do. So no matter what you're posting, you're commenting, this is what people are going to see. So unlike loads of like LinkedIn gurus, I don't think

that one sizefits all for this. It has to completely depend on your goals. However, to help you, I'm going to put onto the screen now my own formula for how I think that business owners and founders and entrepreneurs should think about the structure of their headline. So I've put together this card for everyone to use which will help you put together your headline. So it would be I

am a job title. So I am a founder or a entrepreneur or a practitioner that helps. And then the target ICP it might be I help brands or businesses or if you're more niche it might be accounties or law firms whatever it is. So I am a marketeteer that helps brands that could be it so far. uh achieve a desired result by said action. So if I was to string that all together, for example,

when I first built my first business, which was an agency, it was I am a marketeteer that helps luxury brands to attract high netw worth individuals. And so that was my headline when I was getting started in my career. And the simplicity of that is that if someone if my target audience was to see one of my posts or see one of my comments elsewhere, they would immediately

identify me as the type of person that could help them and their business. If your goal is to simply grow your account and build attention, you want to include your position and the topics you talk about within your content. For example, founder of the Creator Accelerator. I post about entrepreneurship, personal branding, and leadership. If the goals is to land specific clients or to drive

people towards your business, you need to be very specific with who you are as we just discussed. So if you take the example from me, one of my products is the creator accelerator. I help six, seven, and eight figure entrepreneurs build their personal brand through actionable strategies. So you can play around with this to suit you and to suit your business, but it's very important

to be focused on your goal and the right followers. So your about section should now take that further. It should be sharing a really relatable story about the struggles that you've faced, the lessons that you've learned, how you've helped others to achieve their goals, which is similar to your ideal customer. It should have a clear destination for people to go to. So, if you're a

coaching business, you should have a link to your coaching. If you're an agency, a link to your agency. If you have a SAS product, a link to your SAS product. If you were to look at my about section now, because I have a portfolio of businesses, my about section will focus on my journey as an entrepreneur. It will go through the different businesses that I've built in my life

and the different age stages that I've had in my life. And I feel like that gives depth and awareness to the audience that I'm not a one-time founder. I'm not like a LinkedIn coach. I am a entrepreneur that helps entrepreneurs to scale their businesses. And so it's good to show people that type of variety of business experience because that is what founders ultimately

need. So in your case, your headline super specific, you know, answers the ICP, but the about section can get deeper into a little bit about you, your background, and how you've become who you are. The other really important things to call out on the profile is your featured section and your job section. And so from a featured section perspective, you can have two or three

or even more. I would suggest having two effectively call to actions for your products. As I always tell founders and businesses, the most important thing to understand about social media in general is that the platforms limit your reach. And that limiting of the reach depends on the platform and depends on the time. So when I was 21 years old, we could build Facebook pages up to a million

followers in a couple of weeks. And yet nowadays, if you were to try and do that, it's near impossible. And so when I first started using LinkedIn, it was much easier to grow. And so the point is always I am always trying to get my followers to come off the social media platforms and subscribe to my newsletter. And we call this deplatforming. And so no matter what,

you will always see whether it's on my Instagram, on my LinkedIn, on my YouTube, whatever. I'm always trying to push people to my newsletter so that I actually own the relationship with my follower and with my community rather than if you have a thousand followers, you're likely that LinkedIn will only show your post to 100 people or 200 people. And so you're going to struggle

to access even your own followers. It's the same thing on Instagram. And so when it comes to your featured section, I would always recommend that people have some form of newsletter or long- form content that someone can go and subscribe to. And then the other part of the featured section, personally, I would always suggest that that should be a inquiry form, a weight list form, a

subscription form, a buying form. That is an actionable step that someone will take. So for example, on my profile at any time, these links will change depending on what business I'm actually pushing at the time. And so right now you will see that on the left hand side this is pushing my newsletter and so people can sign up to my newsletter and over the last year I've built a

newsletter of 250,000 subscribers who I can email every Sunday now and no algorithm can get in the way of that. So think how powerful that really is. And then the other one will be pushing people to my creator academy products. So whether you join the community or you join a live in-person coaching by me or whether you join live inerson coaching in a group format online in the cohorts,

I will be pushing that on this tile always. The other thing to bear in mind is your job section where you can effectively have listed as your job and then underneath you can create as I have here a media piece and you can check out on my profile how I've done it. You can add your job, your title, and then underneath you can click a media element. So the audience can click that

media element and they go straight through to the landing page as well. So, what I would always say, and Horoszi talks about this quite a lot in his content, is that I make content every single day, which I'm going to get into in a minute, but the key is that once someone likes my content and they come to my profile, I want them to be able within a few clicks to understand what I

do, what I offer, how to sign up for more content from me, and how to check out my businesses. So before we actually go on to the content creation, what content works to grow your brand, first it's very important to understand who you are making content for and so who is your ICP. I created this sheet which is the anatomy of the perfect LinkedIn post and I talk about on this sheet the five

proven LinkedIn posts that will grow your audience. And these aren't specific just to LinkedIn. This is how content works. However, I've kept it in the context of LinkedIn just so people can get started really practically. So firstly, who is your ICP? Let's think about someone who runs an accountancy business. So as an accountant, you want to attract to you business owners and

business leaders who are interested in learning about accountancy and learning about how to manage their business better from a financial perspective. And so if I'm an accountant, I am making content about how entrepreneurs and businesses can utilize new taxes, how entrepreneurs and businesses can reduce their tax liability, how entrepreneurs and businesses can help their staff to

be paid more through better taxes. I'm trying to create content that is financially aligned for my business and is going to attract me the right customers. And so if you think about my example that I gave earlier, I am trying to create content for entrepreneurs looking to grow because my services broadly are I invest in businesses, I mentor founders and I teach people about

how to scale their profile and scale their business. So I want to get entrepreneurs into my funnel and be interested in my business because I want to be able to talk to them about my services later down the funnel. And the great thing is at the top of the funnel, you're just giving away free and incredible value the whole time. So the number one thing that people always say

to me when I talk to them about the power of LinkedIn is actually what do I post about? Like I don't know what to post. How could I possibly post every single day? And so I think with all things you have to create a system. And so what we always try and teach people is that over one or two pages, we call it the three-page personal brand document. And I can just flash that up

now. We call it the three-page personal brand doc because on those three pages, I want it to be so abundantly clear who the ICP is, who the person you're making content is for, and what content you're going to make for them. And so for me, I would say there's never a day that I don't know what I'm posting because I'm always posting for entrepreneurs who are interested in growth and scale. I'm

always posting about topics those entrepreneurs are interested in. And so I might post about uh startups, businesses, scale, building your profile. I might post about delegation automation. I might post about AI. All the things that entrepreneurs who are interested in growth will be interested about reading about. They might want to talk about leadership and culture and

mentorship and growth, you know, having a growth mindset. All these topics fit perfectly within the realm of talking to entrepreneurs. And so, if I write down the sheet who I'm targeting, what I talk about, very quickly, I can put together titles for lots of different posts I'm interested in. So here are five posts that are proven to grow your brand and grow your brand at speed. And I just

want to say I feel like there is a trend where people talk about growing slowly is more authentic. I personally don't understand that in the context of trying to grow a business. I am trying to grow a business and I want to grow that business as fast as possible, as sustainably as possible and as authentically as possible. But I don't want to have to sacrifice speed. And so

one of the things that I think people have been very good at over the years is taking incredibly prevalidated ideas. Ideas that we know everyone loves and aligning them with their brands. So if you think about what an author is, they are an ordinary person who goes deep on an idea and makes that idea a massive part of their personal brand. And so for example, if I was to write a book about

delegation and I was to go very deep on talking about delegation every single day, I would attract a lot of entrepreneurs to my brand and I would talk about delegation every single day. So if you're sat there thinking to yourself, what do I post about? How do I post about these things? I would say pick the topics you love. Pick the things that align with you and your

audience and start making content about them. And so I talk about this here, which is the awareness post. So the awareness post needs to be lightweight. It needs to be easy to read, easy to like, easy to reshare, easy to empathize with, and and easy to relate to. And for you, that means that you need to be able to capture the essence of big topics in small quotable formats. Whether that's

you quoting someone else or whether that's you making a statement, however that post comes out, it needs to be short, snappy, relatable, and it needs to be easily sharable. And so those posts will get easy lift on your account whether that's Instagram, you know, LinkedIn, anything. Those posts will get traction because the ideas behind them are pre-validated. And so prevalidated

ideas is simply the idea that if we think about habits for a second, you watching this are well within your rights to talk about habits and stacking habits and so forth. And so there are incredible ways to approach that which might be firstly looking at habits from James Clear and looking at some of his most prevalidated quotes looking at the power of habit by Charles Dig which is a

book that predated atomic habits and that's how you can start to put together some quotes on habits but also think about what are the quotes that you want to create on habits that really align with your personal brand and what you stand for. The second post is what I would call the personal post. So you want people to be able to buy into you. I think the problem with personal brand

and I think the problem with content in many ways is it's become impersonal. It's become too formulaic. And so you want to be pushing out personal stories. You want to be creating stories and moments that your audience can connect with you on a personal and deeper level. And so for example, I will often tell stories about my challenges as an entrepreneur, my challenges with my

family, my challenges in life in general. And I think that builds depth with the audience. And I also love being honest and transparent about those stories. And so try not to look like your page is just like a meme page or an information page. You are a person and you have to have a personal brand. So don't forget to write personal stories and create personal content which is

photos and a look behind the curtain of your life and that is the most important thing. The third post is probably the most important and probably the most forgotten about post in the whole quantum of personal brand which is the education post. The education post is in my opinion the most forgotten and overlooked post there is which is effectively content about the pillars we

were talking about earlier. So things I talk about delegation, automation, business scaling, etc. How do I help entrepreneurs with those things? And so from an educational standpoint, I want to help someone go from A to B in scaling their company from 1 million to 5 million. And so what are the steps that I might put towards, you know, helping that person do it? Create that

as a piece of content. You know, in my life, I've raised 35 million in venture capital funding before. And so I made a infographic carousel about how to raise VC funding. And that piece of content got me hundreds of people reaching out to me to say, "One, thank you for the content, but two, this has really helped me with raising money." And so, the post we were talking about before, the

awareness post, in my opinion, is about brand building. It's about aligning ideas with your brand. It's also about getting a lot of impressions and likes and so forth on your content and quickly. And so, what happens, as with happens with any social media platform, by the way, and I'm going to give you the example of Instagram for a second. If you're on Instagram and you hover

over someone's post for a couple of seconds, what happens is Instagram then four or five videos on will show you that person's profile again. It happens the same on Tik Tok. It happens the same on all platforms. And so I like someone's post. Even if I don't like it, I just watch it. They will serve me that person's content again. And so my theory has always been that by having these

awareness posts, it garners an audience. It garners people who are going to be served our content. and then maybe they served different parts of our content later on. And so broadly, ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about the content funnel without talking about it. We're talking about the top of the funnel being lightweight, you know, ideas that resonate with our audience

that are aligned with our brands. The middle of the funnel starts becoming educational. It's how you go from A to B on these topics. how you scale your company, how you raise funding, how you build profile, all these different topics like how you do business strategy was one of my most successful sheets ever because hundreds of founders reached out and said, "Thank you so much

for showing us these strategic models that we can use in our companies." And so don't forget that people will follow you and follow you intently if and only if you are able to educate them and support them on their journey. The fourth post is actually the how we do it post. It is my intellectual property or in this case it could be your intellectual property. It is about how

my business specifically solves my ICP's problem. And so when I was 21 through 30 and I ran Verb brands, our content we produced was about how Verb helped luxury brands connect with high netw worth individuals. And so the content we created was things like the state of luxury rapport or luxury IQ. And it was literally how to help brands target and connect with and you know build demand

amongst the high netw worth individuals. And we built that company over 10 years and sold it. But one of the things we were best at was getting big brands into our marketing funnel and coming to our events. And they often said that the reason they did is because we had a very distinct way of talking about how we captured attention. And that was effectively the framework and the

intellectual property that sat behind Verb Brands. It was it was our ethos. It was our thinking. It was our framework. And so other agencies didn't have that. And so we immediately distinguished ourselves. And immediately in a crowded market, we're able to differentiate ourselves, which is super important. And so these posts are about your specific IP. So key is create IP specific to your

business. And you can see here this framework, the play framework is a framework that's in my book. It's about how to build profile. And so this is not something I've ever seen anywhere else. This is a specific framework that belongs to me. I created this framework. And so that is specifically how we do things. And that again is if you think about the funnel again, that's deeper

down the funnel. I've educated them or I've brought them in. I've educated them. I'm now educating them with my specific differentiated view on how to do marketing. The fifth post and and the final post is something that people do a lot of but doesn't work for them. And so this is like what I would call the conversion post. It's about taking the interested parties through and pushing

them to actually make a sale, pushing them to actually make an inquiry. People post this every single day. They post conversion posts every single day like sign up, become my customer, you know, please, you know, click here, etc. Whereas, in my opinion, you have to garner the attention, guide people through discovering you, be educated on your content and come through to

specifically how my business solves your problem. And then that person who's been through your funnel and understands your business, knows how you do things, they see a post that you release, which is a testimonial, a case study, or it might just be an example of the work that you've done. So just using the same example we were talking about earlier, my agency which targeted luxury brands

to help them target high net worth individuals, we would post case studies of how we grew Bugatti's Instagram from 500,000 followers to 3 million followers and the impact that had actually had on sales. And so people were finding Bugatti on Instagram and were then signing up to the weight list to buy a Bugatti and be vetted because you have to be vetted to buy a Bugatti. And so we

did this for, you know, Rolls-Royce, Aston Martin, Sunseeker yachts, but they were coming into us through posts that were effectively case studies. However, they didn't just happen across our profiles. They would have been through the state of luxury report. They would have looked at our luxury IQ data. They would have learned about how our business worked and they would have

followed us for a while and myself and my business partner for a while. And then at the moment that they needed support, at the moment they needed help, they knew there was someone in the luxury world that they could talk to who understood this. And so these posts, the conversion post are about pushing existing desire, as in people who are in your funnel and turning that desire into

demand and then into a customer. The most important thing to convert traffic into an inquiry or into a revenue is to make sure that the case study is real. Make sure that the audience member can click on the case study, can review the case study, can understand the transformation and can go and research it themselves. I have been building businesses for 15 years and my biggest

pet peeve across all of my businesses. For example, when I ran Lotty, which is a big health tech business, we were often working with agencies and they would send us their case studies. They'd be like, oh yeah, we've worked with like Nike. And I'd be like, what do you do for Nike? And they're like, oh, it's an NDA. And I'm like, well, that's not a useful case study for me. Just putting

the logo doesn't help me. And then I would also work with coaches and consultants who would say, you know, I helped so and so entrepreneur, call them Joe blogs, go from 1 million to 10 million revenue. And so the most powerful case study you can do is a bit more like this. You can say, I helped Dr. Caroline Frost go from 20,000 followers and no business to 200,000

followers and a soldout business in the space of 6 months. Go and check out her profile and if you want, go and reach out to her. Now, what I've committed to in my businesses these days is only doing those types of case studies because I am not here and I'm not about fake case studies. I want to produce an incredible case study, which means that I have to produce a product that

fundamentally works. And so, I would say to all the entrepreneurs out there that are thinking about launching a product, the most important thing in the world is that your product fundamentally delivers because your product will be marketed by your customers. And the better your customers do, the more case studies you'll get and the more word of mouth you will get. So before I tell you how

to sell on LinkedIn, which is also how you sell online and how to sell through Instagram and social in general, before I get to that, I wanted to talk about what pre-validated content actually is. And so if you're sitting there and you think to yourself, I don't know what to post about. And then you come up with some topics that you want to post about. So like you've made the move from not

knowing to knowing. Now, how do you make that content? I would say that this is the most important thing that really good content creators very rarely ever speak about which is the best books in the world that came out over the last 10 years closely not exactly but closely follow you know 10 or 20 books that came out 10 years before them. And so why is that? It's because certain topics and

certain ways of talking about certain topics resonate very deeply with people. And so when I think about creating content, I don't think about creating content completely from scratch. I don't think about creating content completely new. I actually did English at school and one of the things you learn is that there's only seven story lines at all. And so trying to create completely new

things in my opinion is just too much work and and most the time impossible. And so what I do if I ever think to myself, I want to create an amazing resource to help entrepreneurs understand delegation, I want to look at almost every single super successful piece of content ever on delegation. I want to look at YouTube videos, LinkedIn posts. I want to look at books that have

sold incredibly well. And I want to understand what it was about that content that made the topic of delegation, which is and can be quite boring, super useful. And then I want to look at how we can make content that is very actionable. And so I am pre-validating the fact that delegation as a topic is going to do well. And so if I was in your position and you now

have your topics that you know you want to talk about that are going to connect with your ICP, think about where you can find incredible content that has already been out there on the internet. Maybe it's creators you like, businesses, books, whatever. and study what's come before you because that is how you're going to get a bit of a jump on how to create the most incredible content. This

is the part of the video where things are going to get a little bit more complicated and a little bit more advanced. But this is the stuff. It is these techniques and these tools and this methodology that will allow you to generate hundreds of thousands if not millions a year from understanding digital marketing and then understanding how to convert traffic into actual

revenue. And so companies talk about this all the time, but I I feel like what is very important for an entrepreneur to understand is that there is a relationship between your personal profile and the traffic that you then drive into your business. And that traffic is what we're going to talk about now. I like to start here with the anagram which is serve. So the most

important thing to remember at this stage is my phrase don't sell serve. And so what does serve stand for? Which is show up consistently, educate, relate to their needs, value over transactions, and engage with authenticity. So you're not selling to them, you are serving them. And so to what we've talked about a lot in the video, it's about educating your audience and taking them from a

place where you now have left them in a better position than when you found them. So I don't want you making content about nothing. You know, I want you to be making content about topics that your audience actually care about and topics you can actually help people on. Right? That is step one to actually learning how to sell. Step two is about social selling, which is traditionally what we

did before social media in selling to other businesses. We would build relationships with people. We would become close with people so that when they needed our service, we were there. And so when thinking about that in a social media context and specifically with a LinkedIn context, you can filter your profile, whether that's just with the LinkedIn filters or you can use

Sales Navigator to filter your profile again. So you only see the content that's coming through from your ICP. So to go back to my example of the business I owned in my 20ies, we had an agency that was aimed at luxury brands to help them connect with high net worth individuals, right? And so who was our ICP? It was luxury brand marketeteers. And so I would have my LinkedIn filtered

to only have the content from luxury brand marketeers and I would spend hours going through commenting on people's profiles trying to add real value be like did you check out this thing you know this video might help you have you seen this blog post did you see this event I'm speaking at this thing would you like to come and so I spent a lot of time effectively curating relationships

and building connections the oldfashioned way which was you know adding value to existing conversations on the platform. And so to any entrepreneur out there, that is the single fastest way of getting your ICP to buy into you. Content is one thing. It's top of funnel, but actually connecting with people is at a much deeper point of view. And so it all

works in a sort of flywheel, right? I can connect with someone cold and their likelihood of following me will depend on the connection, but also depend on my content. And so you need both. And so in this situation, I would reach out to brands and say, "Hey, have you ever considered the idea that your brand could enact this marketing strategy?" Or, "Have you ever considered that I saw

this other brand do this marketing strategy and I think that might work really, really well for you? No obligation whatsoever. Love your brand, love the marketing you're doing." I used to reach out to marketing directors and say, "Since you joined that brand, I love X, Y, and Zed about what the brand has done." And so, I'm just building rapport. and building the opportunity to

have a conversation with them. And so people forget this step. They just make content over here. They forget about social selling. And so if you're selling something of high value and our agency back in the day used to sell really expensive services, you know, $100,000 a month type services to brands, sometimes more. And so you needed a really strong relationship with the marketing director

before they even considered you. And so people buy those types of services in person. And so we had to get all those people to come to events. So the first step is obviously content. The second step is social selling. The third step is deplatforming them and getting them to an email list or to an email and then to an event and selling at the event. The third point here is about making

sure that your offer is super clear. And so I'll tell you very quickly a story about how my agency went from making a million a year to 10 million a year. And that came in the fact that at the beginning we were called adjust media and we served every brand that would be interested in working with us. So we did all types of marketing for all brands. We then released a landing page and that

landing page was Verb Brands that helps luxury brands connect with high net worth individuals. So it cut off 90% of the market. We could no longer work with 90% of brands cuz they weren't luxury. However, to the brands that mattered, our ICP, they saw that positioning and were like, "Wow, that's the agency for me." And so, I would say to everyone, positioning is absolutely critical. And

you can change your positioning over time. And so, at the very beginning, we were luxury hospitality and fashion brands. And then we became luxury brands. And then we became later on luxury and premium brands, which gave us scope. And it allowed us when we were a much bigger company to acquire customers who were high street retailers who weren't specifically luxury but were

premium and wanted to play in that luxury space. And so your branding and positioning can change over time. But make sure that you have a very very clear positioning at all points in time. And if you then change it later on, make sure it's clear again who the target audience is and who you're helping. So number four is about education content which we spoke about earlier. It's about

creating lead magnet worthy content. And by that I mean someone sees a piece of content, it's so good that they want to download it and have it themselves or they want to download that and get part two or they want to download that and get access to something else. So the example I'm going to give you is based on my second business which was Lotty with my brother which is a a company

aimed at helping elderly people find care. And so our customer was the people who owned care homes. It was the people who owned these big care facilities. They were our customer. And so we wanted them to find out who we were. We wanted those people to subscribe to our newsletter so we could invite them to events and tell them about our platform, tell them about our software and our

solutions. And so what we used to do very much based on the playbook I had established in my 20ies before I sold Verb with Lotty, we now released the state of care. And this report was about the care industry. It was about changing trends and how people were going from making phone calls and booking care to now booking online. And so these brands had to be super digitally savvy if they

wanted to capture the incoming demand of the children of the elderly people because they were much more digitally savvy. And so these reports started to be released quarterly, six monthly. We produced care IQ which was our own data set from our own platform about how people in the care industry were actually acting. And so relate this back to your business. Think about what is

the content you can create that is going to be so good that your target audience want to download it and subscribe to your newsletter. So if you think at my agency, the newsletter was called the luxury lens. At my health tech company, it was called Care IQ. And for our media and education business, the newsletter is called Stepbyep. So in all those examples, you can see how those

newsletters appeal to the target audiences. And so step by step creates content about entrepreneurs. We deplatform them into the newsletter and they learn step by step how to build businesses, scale businesses, scale personal brand, etc. All the things that we talk about and that is where they do it. So ladies and gents, we're going to get more detailed, more advanced now. So

you're going to need a pen and paper if you're going to want to do this properly. So the next step, right, if someone likes our lead magnets or our education online, they will go onto a page and I can flash that up here and they will hit download on that page. They'll download that resource and in doing so they will subscribe to my newsletter. Immediately after they

subscribe to my newsletter though, they're subscribed and that's how most people leave it. That is not correct. The next thing you want to do is actually ask that person some questions about who they are. And so the first question you get on my newsletter after you subscribe is how can I help you? How can I help you growing your business or growing your audience? And

so someone pre-seelelects the fact that what they're looking for in terms of guidance and so the amazing thing is I can ask that question and then ask another question which might be do you own a business? And then once they answer that I'll say how many staff do you have in that business? What revenue do you have in your business? And by asking all these questions in a really

detailed manner, by the time that someone finishes the questionnaire, I might know that I have four or five different segments of my audience. I might have the entry-level entrepreneurs who need free content. They can't pay for anything. They don't want training. They want free content on the internet. I love those people. That was me. I then have the people who might have the six

figure businesses who might want some online community, you know, accountability from different people. They might want educational type content. They might want YouTubetubes. They might want longer form, more in-depth education stuff. And then I've got seven, eight figure entrepreneurs who want in-person training. They want cohort-based group training for

connection to other 8 figure owners so they can have accountability. They could talk about big problems. And then you might go all the way through to as I do, some of the people that I coach are people who have hundred million pound businesses and even a few businesses worth billions. And those people want to have very intimate relationships with other people in the same position. And

so what I'm able to do once I have all that information is curate content and offers and products and businesses based on that. Because if I was to send a $10,000 consultancy product to a six figure owner, they're going to be like, "Why the hell are you sending me that? That's not relevant for me at all." And so what I'm able to do is only send that offer to the relevant person. And then

the rest of my list could just get an offer of buying my book or buying my community, the creator academy or buying the creator accelerator cohorts. It depends where you are and what you're ready for and how you select what you want to learn about. And so I ask them the question, how do you like to learn? And by asking how you like to learn, they tell me online, in person, in

cohorts for accountability, they tell me what they want. And so in a year's time, I'm releasing my book. In a year's time, I want to be able to market my book to every single person on my newsletter. But in the meantime, I don't want to lose my whole newsletter by selling them the wrong product. And so this is called segmentation. It's called personalization. And if you want to

learn how to market properly, that is what you need to learn because social media is effectively a tool to pull people off social media platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook and all the rest of it. and deplatform them onto your own list so that you own the relationship with them and you're able to provide so much more value. I find it very interesting that when I look at a

creator or a thought leader who has 100,000 followers and their posts only get a couple thousand likes, that means they're only able to reach a couple of percentage points of their audience, which in my mind is a bit crazy. Whereas throughout that building journey, throughout that audience building journey, if someone had set up a newsletter and you had those 100,000

people on your newsletter, every Sunday morning, I can send them an email and I can send them the email that they want to receive based on what they answered. And so segmentation and personalization is absolutely critical to take people on a journey and give them the content and the products that they want. And I can tell you from personal experience that is how you convert people for higher

ticket products. And that is how you guide people from the beginning of their journey as for example a six-figure entrepreneur through to now they've built their business from six figures to seven to eight figures and are still interested in the different products that I have to sell. And that is because there is a laddered approach. I'm serving them the content that they need

when they need it. Now, before I go into the last section, which is how the new algorithm in 2025 actually works based on thousands of profiles and thousands of pieces of data that we have analyzed and put together to help other creators make better content. Before I do that, if you've liked this video, please like and subscribe and let me know in the comments what content you want me to

produce next and how I can help you. So, how does the algorithm work? What are the hacks that you need to know to give yourself the best chance at success? First, I want to talk about the fact that people say, you know, screw the algorithm or like you shouldn't be making content for an algorithm or, you know, you shouldn't be hacking a platform and all the rest of it. I just

take the view that I am making the best content that I possibly can for my business, but understanding the game is the most important thing. Like, why would I play the game and not know the rules? And so if we're talking about LinkedIn, I can tell you strategically what the hacks are. I can tell you what types of content are more likely to do better than others, what types of

designs are likely to do better than others. If we're talking about Instagram, I can tell you the same things, but for Instagram, they vary platform to platform. But if you were to start making content on Instagram and do it in the exact same way that you do it on LinkedIn, it's not going to work. And so the most important thing that I would say to you is the way that I've

structured this video is so that you start with what's my ICP, how to create great content, understanding pre-validated content, how to make education content, how to convert people. This last part, this is the 1%. This is the stuff that's going to make your content much more aerodynamic moving forwards. So, you can see in this report that we put together, and we're

releasing another even more in-depth one soon, the type of post matters enormously. And so, carousels and infographics and cheat sheets are working at almost two times better than any other style of post. And that's two times better in terms of impressions, but also two times better in terms of follower conversion. And so, if you're making content that's not in those

formats, that's totally fine. It's likely that it could do well. And sometimes it might do incredibly well, but the odds are that if you're making highly welldesigned infographics or cheat sheets or carousels that convey the message, whatever the message may be, you are more likely to succeed than someone who isn't. And so when someone says to me, "Oh, ignore the platform.

Make content specifically for people." It's like, I am making the best content I possibly can for my audience, which typically is demonstrated by the fact that the content gets a lot of engagement. But the important thing is I'm making it in the format that works best for the platform at the time, but also works best for the person because the platform is going to distribute the

format that works best. And when people spend more time on content, it signals to the platform that that is good content. And so if you're making your content in really dense and really educational, really high value content, people have to spend time reading that content. And then from reading that content, they might actually comment and get engaged and that is what pushes the

algorithm. And so don't try and push water uphill. Don't listen to the naysayers. Like make the best content you possibly can for your ICP, but don't make it in a format that's not going to work. Make it in the format that's going to give you the best chance at working. So, as you can see from the diagram, the way content works right now is that carousels convert the best, then

infographics and cheat sheets, then it moves into videos, then it moves into polls, then it moves into text and photos, and then text. So, I'm not in any way saying that creators shouldn't make text and text and photo posts. But what I am saying is that as an entrepreneur watching this video or as someone who wants to grow their profile, you might as well make infographics and

carousels because it's going to grow your account faster, generate you more leads faster, get you more email subscribers faster, get you more customers faster. And so I don't think it's inauthentic. I think it is absolutely tactically what you should do to grow your business. I wanted also to talk a little bit about comments and engagement because this is again where

you see a huge amount of engagement and a huge amount of push that goes on the platform. So AI obviously came about a few years ago firstly with chat GBT but now with all these other tools that enable commenting and so forth. The key ladies and gents is that these platforms social media platforms LinkedIn specifically do not like AI comments. And so I would advise people that in the

science of commenting, you should be doing comments that are 10 words, no less 10 words, because it signals that it's a real comment. It shouldn't be AI generated. It shouldn't come from an AI. It should be a legitimate comment on the post about the post because you're also trying to build a relationship. And so if like me you have a team that support you in running your social platforms the

most important thing is to ensure that your team have the skill set and the knowithall to comment and create content as you representing your personal brand. It is absolutely critical that that is the case. Don't just hook your account up to really bad automatic AI tools. One of the stats that is unequivocal is the fact that if you're engaging with 10 to 20 to 30 accounts a day on your profile,

you are likely to see a 50% overall impression increase. And so again, as an entrepreneur looking at growing my profile tactically, I know by being present and engaged on the platform, commenting on people's profiles, people commenting on mine, me responding gets my account into a position where it is likely to see more impressions. Now, I don't know why I wouldn't do that. If

that is the price it costs to get my profile to be more likely to be seen by my target audience, I will do that. And I would say that most big creators that I look at, I'd say almost all are people who are quite present on the platform. They are engaged with that ICP. They're engaged with their audience. So, if you want your post to do better and your profile to do better, then be engaged.

Be engaged with your audience and with your ICP. So finally, I'll leave you with three key tips from the algorithm report, which are three tips on how to increase your post performance. Number one, content that has strong idea or data visualization, as in infographics or ideas that are visualized. So for example, I could create a post about the five keys to scale. So the five keys to

scale a brand. It might simply be that the visualization is five different keys. It could be five keys opening five different locks. Whatever it might be, you're just visualizing an idea so that someone can catch it in the feed so they don't scroll past it. So, you're effectively marketing your content. And so, that is point one. Number two, posts that have two sentence hooks are

performing the best right now. They're performing 20% better than any other hook. And so, when you think about that, why are you not going to be writing your post with two sentence hooks? It's not very hard to turn any type of hook into a two sentence hook. And again, for specificity sake, the first line is 65 characters and the second line is 45 characters before it creates an ellipsus

and see more. And so tactically, as an entrepreneur who wants to get my content seen, those are the types of hooks I'm going to create right now. And finally, the third point, posts that are educational and posts that support people in going from A to B, you know, from one to two, from startup company to understanding how they make their first £100,000 a year or whatever it might be.

Those are the posts that when they hit and they don't hit every single time, but when an educational post lands with the audience and gets liked and commented on and reposted and so forth, those are the posts that drive 80% of the follower growth. And so really truthfully, if you're going to create content in 2025 and moving forwards, create content that actually helps your

ICP to achieve their objectives. So ladies and gentlemen, those are the five steps on how to build followers and land clients on LinkedIn and how to do it fast.

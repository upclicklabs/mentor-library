# Expert Insights into AEO - Webflow University with Ethan Smith

Hello everyone. I'm Adrian Rosenrance, chief revenue officer here at Web Flow. And today I'm joined by Ethan Smith, CEO of Graphite. Graphite is a leading SEO and growth marketing agency that has helped some of the world's most recognized brands scale their organic reach. Ethan has been at the forefront of how AI is transforming search and has spoken extensively about answer engine

optimization and the future of discovery online. Ethan, thank you so much for joining. >> Excited to be here. >> Let's kick it off with breaking down the history of search and how people find information online. Can you tell us a little bit about what the last 20 years have been like? >> Sure. So, Google launched in the early

[clears throat] 2000s and there were a bunch of search engines that launched before them, but right around the late 90s and the early 2000s. And so, uh, Google, one of their key, uh, innovations was page rank where depending on how many people link to you, you're more important because relevance was solved, but the authority problem was not solved. And so, Google

invented page rank and then they they built their authority signal around that. And that's how they won is having a better sorting of the URL or the domains and the URLs that show up. So, it's not just about the relevance problem, which is actually easier, it's about the authority problem. And you actually see that now with some of the LLMs where they they have good uh

relevance, but they're struggling to figure out which sites should be the most authoritative. And so Google's been able to build that up over the last 25 years. And so a lot of the parallels for what we see what we have seen work in search also apply to LMS. >> Amazing. What is AEO actually? >> Yeah. So how I define AEO is I want my brand or my website to be recommended in

an answer. So if I ask what's the best website builder, what's the best payroll management software, I want my product to show up just like I want my product to show up when someone's searching for that in Google. So AEO is optimizing for your brand or your product to appear in an LLM answer. >> And what are some common misconceptions about answer engine optimization? I

think the number one misconception is that it's completely different from SEO and there's a lot of similarities because you know the underlying technologies search is a key part of LMS when you ask a question. Frequently search is is a part of that and so the same strategies that apply for SEO apply for uh answer engine optimization. So I think the number one misconception is

that they're totally different. There are some differences which is the head and the tail. The head is you optimizing for the head is optimizing for off-site and for the tail a lot of questions have never been answered before and a lot of questions have never been searched for before. So the tail is larger and longer but the core principles of SEO all apply for AEO.

>> Amazing. So let's break down some of these acronyms because we're hearing so many of them. So we have SEO, we have AEO, we have GEO, we have AIO. Can you just choose and break down the most important ones you think everyone should better understand so if they're trying to build a strategy today on how they are discoverable online. >> Sure. So we can first describe what

exactly are we doing and then we can describe the acronym to that uh represents that. So search engine optimization is optimizing for search engines. That could be Google, that could be Bing, that could be Yahoo, that could be YouTube. These are all different kinds of search engines. And so the field of SEO is optimizing for showing up at search engines. Now there

are LMS like chat like perplexity and so we want to help promote our brand and our product in those uh products. So then what is the name for helping uh promote your product in these new services uh large language models and so you know ultimately the name uh the best name is what everyone agrees the name should be. So there's not an objective objectively true name for this, but um

we're figuring out what that name could be. Uh they all sort of are trying to represent the same same thing. So there's answer engine optimization, there's generative engine optimization, there's AI search engine optimization, and then there's a AIO AI optimization. We will see uh ultimately what what the best name is. But, you know, back to the actual question is, um, we're optimizing

for LMS. Uh, and so, uh, is how different is that from optimizing for search engines? And I think that there's actually a lot of similarities in search engine optimization and optimizing for LMS because LMS are frequently doing searches. So, a lot of the core principles for SEO apply to marketing for uh, LMS. >> Very interesting. I think one thing you

mentioned that is so important is that agents or large language models are actually using search uh to get answers to questions. And so I think this gets us to this big debate that exists today which is SEO is it dead? And I'm curious to get your take on it given actually LLM do actually search. So, how would you explain whether you think SEO is dead or

is it just evolving? >> Yeah, so I've been researching the history of the death of SEO and uh you know, you can look back for uh quite a while about claims that SEO is dead. And so the first claim by major media that SEO is dead was in 2013 I believe where it was uh social media is going to kill SEO and then it was uh Penguin and Panda and then it was mobile apps are going to

kill not only SEO but the internet and then it was YouTube and then it was Tik Tok and Instagram. So there's all these, you know, every every few years there's a brand new claim that SEO will be dead. And so what we're seeing and the premise is that a new channel growing means an existing channel must go down because it's zero sum. The the pie is fixed. But actually what we're seeing is the slice

of the pie is the same size, but the pie is getting bigger. So Google's slice of the pie organic search is has been flat and it's been flat for multiple years, but these new channels are incremental and add on top of it. And so same with chatbt perplexity the LLMs. This is a new incremental channel. So we're not seeing any drop at all in search. What we're seeing is new channels and uh new

opportunities uh to drive impact. And so that's all additive and all incremental. So premise one is that search is going down which we're not seeing. Uh premise two is that the strategies are entirely different. So the strategies for LLMs and the strategies for search are completely different and they do have some differences but they're you know the core fundamentals are largely the

same which is that frequently there's a search happening and the LM is summarizing the search results. Uh so the core principles still apply but there's a few key differences with optimizing for LMS that are different from uh from search. I'm curious, how do you see expectations changing for a user in SEO and AEO compared to what they might have been a couple years ago as

we've seen more effective predictive engines of what a user wants. I think people's expectations are higher for chat than they are for search because in search Google's saying here are [snorts] some places where you can get an answer whereas in chat chat is saying I have the answer and this is the answer and I'm certain of it and so I think that the an the expectations of the answer in

chat are much higher also I'm asking more specific questions and so my my expectations for the quality of the answer are much higher. What are the key things that you see in SEO and AEO that you believe are true today for both? >> So basically everything in SEO is true for AEO. AO is essentially a superset of of SEO. So if you just do SEO well that'll work for free in SEO and most

companies that are doing well in answer engines, the majority of the reason why is because they did their SEO well. So basically everything in SEO works for AEO. Then AEO is a superet of SEO. So that again the the two things that are different are the head and the tail. Uh so for the head you need to for the most competitive questions you need to not only have your URL show up but have

other people mention you and then the tail which is there are questions that have never been searched for before or even asked before but they're being asked now. So having the answers to these extremely specific questions in the tail. These are the two differences but everything else in SEO still works for answer engines. finding the right topics that you want to target, having

proper uh technical setup, proper internal link architecture, schema, being authoritative, uh getting backlinks, getting shares, and then having content that answers all the questions. All of those work for SEO. All of those work for SEO. >> So, let's get tactical. What are the levers that influence both search engine optimization and answer engine

optimization? >> Yes. So, concept one is topics. and topics I mentioned before where early in Google search you targeted one keyword and you had millions of pages that targeted millions of keywords and now you have hundreds or thousands of pages that target tens of millions of keywords and so groups of keywords are a topic. One page for best website builder can

target a thousand or 5,000 different keywords. And so in search that's a a search topic. In in answer engine optimization, there's maybe, you know, 5,000 different ways to ask the same question of I want to I want you to help me find a website builder. And so we call those topics. And topics are clusters of questions where the intent is generally similar, but there are

these sub themes and subtopics. And so your page can target thousands of questions. Uh, and you want to make sure that the page fulfills the intent of those thousands of questions. And then going from topics to what should be on the page, what is good content? And the way that I think about good content is good content answers all the questions that the user has. And then the same

thing is true for answer engine optimization. If you haven't answered a follow-up question, then uh you're not going to show up. And if you do, then then you will show up. So topics is the first thing. And then comprehensive content is the second thing. Next thing is authority. And so I mentioned that Google's key innovation was their authority algorithm, page rank, and

helping not only figure out what's relevant, but sorting the domain and the URL. that's the best uh quality among the pack. And so the [clears throat] same thing is true for LMS where LM need to have the exact same uh problem which is which domain like I've I found a thousand pages that are relevant. Which of the thousand should I show in what order?

>> So how you think about your content, how you think about the authority, what about the technical setup, is that similar or different between SEO and AEO? >> It's very similar is the short answer. The longer answer is that I mentioned when Google started its algorithm was not mature and it had all of these holes and so technical SEO was born out of

number one uh Google couldn't understand the page and so you needed to help their algorithm and their crawler crawl your site and understand the page you had to go you know above and beyond to do that. The second thing is exploiting all the whole spamming Google by, you know, using games, technical games to exploit their algorithm. And so, you don't need to help Google read your page. Generally

speaking, there's not a lot you need to do to to help Google uh index your page. And there's also not really dramatic holes in their algorithm. So, technical SEO still matters, but it doesn't matter as much. The stuff that matters in technical SEO, the same stuff that matters in answer engines is making sure that Google can crawl your site, traverse your site with good internal

link architecture. Same thing with LMS. You want to make sure that you link to all the content on your site so that the LM can find all the content on your site. Same with Google. So that's the first thing. The second thing is make sure your page isn't broken. And sometimes people will implement JavaScript in a way that just makes it hard for bots to crawl it. usually not

LMS and and Google can both read JavaScript but don't use weird you know page rendering uh there and then the third thing is schema and so schema matters a lot uh schema matters in Google and >> what is schema >> sure so schema is a way to take let's say I have a a restaurant or I have a a hotel and I'm giving Google and I'm g

the name of my uh hotel the uh reviews pictures of my hotel maybe when you can book my And so you're basically creating structured data out of your out of your item and then you're feeding into the LM or or to Google and uh that's all structured and that's all fed into the LM via schema. And so schema is probably the most important thing along with internal link uh internal links and

making sure your page can be read. Those are the three most important things. So, is it fair to say that when you use schema properly, you are taking your website and your page and you're labeling it in very clear ways so that it gets better understood by either an LLM or an SEO um algorithm. >> Yes. And we've also tested adding schema when we when you didn't have schema

before. So, we did a test with Medium where their uh Medium posts with recipes did not have schema. And so then we created something that would automatically create structure out of the recipes and then we added schema to the recipe pages and traffic went up roughly by 20%. So it was pretty dramatic. So the the content was exactly the same thing. We just automatically

added schema and then traffic went up and traffic went up because Google could see that there was a recipe and you know the same is true for LMS. If you go from not having schema to having schema it it makes a big difference. >> Amazing. All right. Then there's the measurement of everything. I think that is really an interesting topic and how do you understand how do you measure SEO

and AEO how different is it how similar is it and how is has it been evolving so it's actually this is one of the things that's dissimilar and it's getting harder and harder to measure so early in Google uh SEO you could measure everything by just getting referral clicks and you could see how many clicks you got from Google and then uh you you could see how many conversions you got

all with last touch referring domain equals Google. So that was easy. And then it's gotten harder and harder. And part of why it's gotten harder is because if I'm deciding whether or not to use uh you know whether or not to buy a car, whether or not to uh sign up for a payroll management software company, I'm not just typing in payroll management software company and clicking

and buying you know spending $50,000. I'm building intent over many many touch points. But you could still see how many clicks did I get from Google. Now with answers, more and more answers are zero click. In fact, most answers are zero click. And so it's getting much harder to actually measure the impact of uh LMS. And so for that reason, the way that I think about it is you measure the

beginning and the end but not the middle. And so by that I mean you can measure when someone converts by asking how did you hear about us? And it's you know it's self-reporting so it's not perfect but you can just ask someone you know how did you get here uh what drove you here that you can measure. The second thing you can measure is am I appearing in answers. So you can take

the set of questions that you want to perform it and you can see am I appearing and you you know you can use there's a whole suite of different answer tracking tools but take the questions that you want to win and see am I appearing. So that's that's the beginning and then how did you hear about us is the end. If I'm starting an answer engine optimization strategy,

where do I start? >> So, you start with which questions do you want to win? And you select the questions that you want to win by figuring out uh what what your paid search keywords are, what what you're ranking for in in Google search. Like, pick those first qu uh keywords and then turn them into questions. And so, then you you start with your topics. Second

is you measure them. So, uh you you put them in a tracking tool and you see how you're performing. What are the patterns for the page types that are ranking? and what are the citations that are uh ranking? The third is technical. So given the the the citations that are ranking, how do you structure your page? Is it a listical? Is it a template? Is it a calculator? Is it an article? So

then you set up your page. Then when you're setting up your page and your website, you need to make sure that your technical infrastructure is set up properly. What and you know the most important things there are your internal link architecture, making sure that the LMS crawl your site and then the second is schema. So if you have a product or a restaurant or a recipe uh showing schema

markup for that particular page type. The fourth is content. And content is answering all the questions that a user has about your product. And then last is authority. And so authority you can break that up into two kinds of authority. It's your authority on site and it's your authority offsite. So on on-site authority is similar to page rank back links, shares, branded search,

you know, just doing good good brand marketing. So, that's your on-site authority, and that helps your URL show up in citations. Then, there's off-site authority, and off-site authority is one of the most one of the biggest differences with LMS uh with with search is offsite. So off-site is uh who else are in the citation set for the questions that you want to win which can

be the patterns that I'm seeing the most are uh UGC. So Reddit, Kora, Stack Overflow, Vimeo, YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, Tik Tok, affiliates, um other you know other other blogs uh but but authority you know the authority now expands in LMS where it's this off-site authority that I need to build. I think we're all very curious to understand how do we optimize our site to show up more

in answers and can you give me an example? >> Sure. So, we actually worked with the web flow team on uh the feature landing pages worked with Vivian and uh we wanted to win in our uh money pages which is design and SEO and uh you know the core features and use cases for web flow. And so what we did was we looked at what questions do people have about

the features that web flow has. And so we looked at forums, we looked at Reddit, what questions, what follow-up questions. So not just what is it and how do I do it, but you know, more detailed specific questions. And so back to good content answers all of the questions that people have. And so we mined those UGC uh forums in Reddit to figure out what the questions were. And

so then we re reworked the page to make sure that we answered those questions. Number one, so the content was there, the answers were there. And then the second thing is uh creating structure around that. So it's even easier for LMS to to see it. So we created uh schema on those feature landing pages. And so then that created structured data that can be fed into the LMS and then the LMS can

more easily find the answer. And so all these changes, better answering the questions, restructuring the content and then adding schema resulted in a 24% lift in visibility. Uh so that's an example of us optimizing on-site. What are things that are really hard because they take a lot of time but are actually also really impactful to drive SEO and SEO?

>> Yes. So, I think content freshness is is probably one of those. And as as the bigger a website is, the more you've already answered a lot of questions and so there's only so many new pages you can create as as as you mature as a website. And so then you want to focus on content freshness. So going back to your top pages, you know, it's common for a page to do really well and then

you start trailing off. You start trailing off because the algorithms want fresh content, uh, recent content. And so a really good strategy as you become a a more established site is to go back to the content that you already have and refresh it. And then the other is, you know, technology is changing so quickly. A lot of things are changing quickly. going back and adding new information

that maybe you know there's new technology and new innovations that are happening adding stuff around that. >> What are the common things that are lowhanging fruit that people just miss when we're talking about how to be discoverable whether it's SEO or SEO? >> The two things that stand out the most that are the quickest wins are your title tags and internal links. And I say

that because these are things that can have a very quick uh effect and they're easy to do. And so title tags are the single most important relevance factor for any of these algorithms. And what I see the most is that you have a title tag that is missing keywords. So if I had a page saying five-year plan and then I don't have examples, uh adding examples in the title, adding examples

in the body will very quickly get you to rank. uh we we we did a an experiment with uh notion where we added I believe we we didn't have examples in the templates page and we added a keyword and we saw traffic go up by I think it was 15 to 20% by just adding stuff to the title tag. So when I I mentioned answering questions that you haven't answered yet, it's not just answering it

in the body, it's also telling the bot in the in the title, which is the most important thing that you that you have examples. And so title tags is the number one quickest win. And then the second is internal links. It's common to not have good cross linking within a site. And a lot of times you have important pages that just aren't linked to enough. So just adding better cross

linking can also have a very quick uh impact. We've we've run several tests where we see 10 to 20% impact within days by uh optimizing internal links. >> Let's break down what cross-linking versus backlinking is. >> Yeah. So backlinking is uh helping authority. So backlinking is another website's linking to me and I mentioned page rank and that that was the key

innovation with page rank which is how do you know which site is legitimate? It's how many other sites are linking to you. So that's what that's what backlinking is and that helps me with my authority that means that my site's going to show up my URLs are going to show up higher in Google higher in LMS because I'm a more authoritative site. So that's backlinking. Then there's

internal links. So internal links is me linking within my own website. And this is an interesting example because in 2008 when I was getting started in SEO, we [clears throat] had a site with millions of pages and I saw a very clear correlation with the more you link to a page, the more likely you are to get traffic. And so the exact same thing is still true today, which is better

linking within your site means your page will get crawled better, which means you'll get more traffic. >> There's a lot of discussion around how you need to have very clean code on your website so you can be found. Can you explain that? >> Sure. So, you know, when we talk about technical SEO, uh it's important that the bot can understand what's on the

page. A misunderstanding is that basic HTML and CSS and JavaScript that LMS can't parse that properly and you need to specially reformat the content in markdown or these other these other formats. And that's not actually true. All you need to do is just have to to not have the page be broken, have it be clean. And so that just means very basic headers, uh, bullet points, images, uh,

schema. It's just don't break the page. Do do things in a basic proper best practice way. This all this stuff matters. As I talk to business leaders, one of the big question is how do they need to think about how the funnel is changing today with these changes going from SEO and now adding AEO? And so it's not a question of doing this versus that. It's invest in all of them. Next

thing is how do I build a team? Like how do I actually win an LLMs? Is that a different team? And my suggestion is it's the same team but the the skills are expanding. And so uh I would hire people to do search engine optimization and then ask them to to expand into these other channels. So I mentioned that optimizing for LLMs has the same underlying uh strategies for for answer

engines to f to to fill the longtail. It's the same principles. It's it's finding out what questions people are asking and then having content that fulfills that building the landing pages very similar your technical infrastructure all of that remains the same. And so when I think about uh building a team to actually execute on that it's take your SEO team and expand

them. And the main thing to expand with your SEO team is keep doing SEO, but optimize for the head and the tail. So the tail is finding those questions that haven't been answered yet, building content around that. And then the head, which is citation optimization, getting mentioned in Reddit, building YouTube videos, affiliates, outreach, uh, and so I would basically take your SEO team and

expand it. But it's not either or. You can do both at the same time with the same team. One of the questions that is often asked is, "Do I focus on showing up in more AEO or SEO results or is that just going to be too hard and I should actually focus just on conversion?" What would be the way you would approach that? >> I would do both. you can optimize for

conversion. And [clears throat] I think that conversion optimization is is a largely misunderstood uh category [clears throat] because people think it's just split testing. Like we're just going to come up with some ideas semi-randomly and like do some split tests and we're going to move the button around and change change the color. But there's a science to how to

do split testing. So there's a science for how to to do the test and there's a science for how to come up with the ideas to test. A lot of people are familiar with how to test, which is you set up a split test and you look for statistical significance. Like that's well understood. The science of what to test is very little understood. And the way to think about a conversion flow is

essentially a decision-making flow. And when a user comes, they have a series of decisions that they need to make. Like if I'm looking for the best payroll management software, I need to know whether or not I trust you, whether or not you fulfill my use case, whether or not you're better than another option. There's all these different decisions that are made and there's science around

each of those uh decisions in decision sciences and psychology. And so I think that if you can break down your conversion funnel into these series of decisions and how those decisions are made, then you can generate the best ideas, then you can test things that are the most likely to test. Most split tests fail because the idea was the wrong idea. And I'll give a specific

example. So, I was working with Honey, the coupon app, and they had they have all these coupons, Kohl's coupons, and Retail Me Not has Kohl's coupons. And so, the obvious, uh, goal of a user on Honey is to get a coupon. Uh, and we played around with button color and button text and, you know, uh, moving that around. We didn't get that many wins, but the actual deeper intent of a

user for Honey is to get a coupon code that works because most coupon codes don't work. So, you have to go through all this work of failed coupon codes and take 10 minutes to find the code. Maybe you never find a code. And what's unique about Honey is that they're figuring out which codes actually work for you. So, then we changed the button text to automatically apply all coupons in one

click. So, you don't have to do all that work and it's the coupon code that works. That I think it doubled or tripled the conversion rate. And it wasn't about how big the button was or what the color was. It was understanding the deep intent of the user and then feeding that into the test. And so you can think about any conversion funnel which is breaking it down into a series

of of decisions, understanding the deep intent and then generating ideas based on that. >> Okay. So conversion matters and it sounds like you don't think we should trade off on AEO and visibility there and it doesn't have to be a one or the other. >> Yeah, I think both matter and you can do the you can do both at the same time and

we also talked about engagement. So Google wants to fulfill the intent. It wants you to eventually convert. Same with LMS and LMs ultimately want to give you an answer and have you complete and fulfill your intent and so I think it's necessary to do both of those. Also, you'll get uh you know you'll get more value out of your traffic if you impre if you improve your conversion rate. Uh

one other interesting thing about answers is that they're much more qualified because uh you know again chat is built for conversations where you're asking all these follow-up questions. So, if I'm asking what the best website builder is with this feature, with this integration that does this, that fulfills my use case, I'm very primed to convert once I've a asked all these

questions and I've gotten answers. So, the the intent of the user is significantly higher for uh for answers. Uh and so the value of the traffic is much much higher, which is why you see companies with 8% 10% of their conversions coming from LM is because they're so primed. And so, I think you want to do both. One other thing that we're seeing is we're seeing an 125%

increase in LM um AI bot crawls on web flow hosted sites. And this is a challenge that is facing all CMOs and CEOs of marketing today. And I'm curious like you said really critically that the pie is getting bigger. um how do you think a CEO or CMO should look at what's happening in the world today and what would you say are the most important principles that they should operate

with? >> Yeah. So I think the the first thing I would recommend is that there are many things to work on and there are not infinite resources. So my general suggestion is whenever there's a new trend don't overindex on what you think it might be. look at what the total size of the channel is today and then look at the growth curve. So the total size of

the channel today for for uh LMS it's still smaller than search. So it's maybe 1/5 or onetenth the size of search but that's still meaningful. So a lot of companies that we work with 8% of their signups are coming from LM. So that's a substantial channel. It's you know a year ago it was maybe 1% or half a percent. And my recommendation is it's interesting. Keep an eye on it, but

don't overindex on a channel that's a half half a percent of your conversions when you could be working on something that's, you know, 30% of your conversions. It's now a meaningful channel. Also, this the uh growth curve is is steep. And so, if you, you know, extrapolate that out a year or two, it's probably going to double or triple. I'm not sure how big it'll be, but it's a

substantial channel. So my general recommendation to executives is to look at the total size of the channel today and what you think it might look like in a year and then resource uh accordingly. The second thing is you don't need to pick just search or just uh optimizing for LMS. You can pick both and so you can have a holistic strategy for both of these. So it's not a question of either

to do SEO or to do answer engine optimization. You can do both. Ethan, thank you for joining today and talking us through SEO AEO, how the world is evolving in the new era of the AI web.

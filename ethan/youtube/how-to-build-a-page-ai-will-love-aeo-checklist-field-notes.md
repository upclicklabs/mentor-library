# How to Build a Page AI Will Love (AEO Checklist) | Field Notes

My dad is texting me asking, "So, how do I get my 
small business to show up in Chat GPT?" The dads   are definitely into it. My dad's a big Claude 
user. He is using like the voice memo though,   the lock or whatever, and just talk. 
Parents love voice dictation. They do. This is our new show, Field Notes. We are going to 
break down everything that is happening within the   world of marketing. Today we're going to break 
down the anatomy of an AEO page and teach you   how to show up in the LLMs like chat GPT. I think 
the first very important thing is that an AEO web   page is a lot more specific and tailored than 
a traditional web page. So, in the old world,   you'd be publishing "The ultimate guide to 
content marketing" and in the AEO world,   you are publishing "The ultimate guide 
to content marketing, if you work at a   logistics company in New Jersey" because answer 
engines surface highly relevant, contextualized,  

tailored information to every person who is using 
them. And so, if you're publishing very generic,   broad content, it's not going to get surfaced 
because it's not matching the specificity that   the answer engines are looking for. That's one 
thing we've started to work on with our content   is how do we add that depth and like where are the 
areas we need to focus. So when we're working on a   content strategy like where where should we start 
when we need to like get that deep and detailed?   Well the first stage of loop marketing is express 
and it's all about understanding your persona and   that is critical for AEO. There are three elements 
that you should be considering. Use case, persona,   and industry. Cool. And so in the express stage, 
you are going to nail down those elements so that   by the time you get to creating and optimizing 
content, you understand exactly who you are   creating and optimizing content for and like 
all that should exist on the page. I feel like  

a lot of folks jump to like the channel tactics 
and how do I optimize for this specific thing,   but it actually starts with the audience, right? 
Like who are we making the content for and then   making sure it's structured for the LLMs to 
understand and site for them. Exactly. So, let's   get to structure. Once you've identified use case, 
persona, industry, and you know what your page is   all about, obviously you need to craft the content 
on that page so that it is as easy as possible for   an answer engine to parse, interpret, and then 
surface it. Okay. And there are some roughly   seven best practices that I've been sharing 
that we've developed and implemented at HubSpot   that I recommend every company who is doing AEO 
start using. The first is put the answer first.   Okay. So, you know those recipe websites where the 
answer is all the way at the bottom under a story.   I've never seen one of those. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No. 
The most hated type of content on the internet,  

I think, and yet we all still need recipes. You 
should be doing the opposite of that. Okay. So,   you want to put the answer to whatever the 
primary question or topic is as high up on   the page as possible. There's a lot of research 
that shows answer engines are paying a lot more   attention to what's up at the top of the page. 
So, if you're trying to teach a company how to   do content marketing, you want to put the answer, 
again, the persona, use case, industry specific   answer in the first sentence of the page. So, I'm 
writing the content. We have that that top module.   What's the second piece we need to consider? 
Well, then you're going to want to expand on   that answer. So you're going to want to have two 
to three paragraphs that give more context, maybe   some examples, some definitions, methodology. 
You basically want to help the answer engine   understand that that response is both credible 
and complete. And what's next after that? Well,  

throughout the entire page, you are going to add 
a ton of structure. Okay. So, something that is   very important to know about answer engines is 
that they are very lazy readers. They're looking   for quick hits. And the more you can break up 
your content with structured lists, with tables,   all the structure that you can add, it's going 
to help answer engines really easily interpret   the page. Sure. Which is better user experience 
anyway, right? Like when you or I go to a page,   I want the headlines, the quick answers, the 
bullet points, that structure. That's why you're   asking Chat GPT to do it for you. Yeah. So, we're 
building. We're building. There's seven things   we have to remember. We have this format. We're 
adding the context. We're adding the credibility.   What's the next piece we got to think about? 
Okay. So, now we're at the bottom of the page.   We're going to add an FAQ. Okay. Have you been 
seeing FAQs everywhere lately? I've seen them,  

especially on folks that are a little more 
progressive and like being aggressive to try   and rank in the LLM. I'm starting to see them pop 
up for sure. Okay. Well, there's a real reason   for that. Okay. First of all, we know that answer 
engines are surfacing answers in a conversational   format, right? Like you ask a question, 
they provide a response. So, the more you can structure your content conversationally, the easier its going to be for an LLM to just grab that content. So that's a big reason for it. But also, answer engines, again,  they're looking for those highly specific answers. So that FAQ at the bottom it lets you expand on whatever the 
main theme of the page is and get to those really specific we call them sub queries.

It feels like within the page, like as you're talking about it, it's all these different modules that are like almost chapters to  your story where it's like help it understand, you know, the initial thesis, help it understand the context,  give it additional questions. Yes. So, really thinking of it in like content blocks as opposed to some long lengthy page that I have to work my way through. You actually hit on something incredibly important, which is something else people should know about the way LLMs pull information is they are not pulling the entire page at once. And 
that's actually a big difference from how   Google interprets pages. Google will look at the 
entire page. An AI engine will just look at one,   two, three paragraphs, okay? And you don't know 
which paragraph that's going to be, right? It's   a very fun uh Easter egg. So, you want to make 
sure that every passage on the page makes sense   in isolation. Okay? So, if I've structured it, I 
have the FAQs. Am I done at that point? Not quite.   Okay. I think as a content guy, you're really 
going to like these next No, you're going to  

like this next one and then you might not like the 
one after that. All right, fair enough. Okay, so   the one that you're going to like is it's really 
important to add original insights throughout.   Okay, answer engines are looking for two things. 
They're looking for consensus. Everyone's saying   the same thing. We can get back to that uh concept 
in a little bit. And they're also looking for net   new information. And the net new information 
is what's going to get pulled into citations,   right? So, how do you provide net new information? 
Well, we call that original insights. And so that   could be data, that could be quotations, market 
research, anything you've got that no one else   has. Well, I think that's the piece that's 
critical, right? Is I think that's where our   worlds start to come together is like at the end 
of the day, we don't want to produce content that   all other brands are producing. You want to have 
an expert. You want their insights. You want their  

lived experience. You want the results from their work. That's the stuff that the search engines and the LLMs are looking for. So that's where the overlap is, where you're going to get the best results. Totally. And, to your point, this is also something that search engines really like. So it's a good two for one. We love a two for one. We love it. 
Okay. You ready for the one that you're not   going to like? Okay. Okay. So, you want to make 
sure every point ties back to the product. Okay.   Yeah. Yeah. Slightly controversial, but here's 
why that's so important. Answer engines are   going to pull all this information, right? 
If you're just providing original insights   and you're not explaining why that original 
insight is so relevant to HubSpot the product,   you're basically making the answer engine 
smarter without getting any recommendation   or visibility from it. So you're going to 
say, you know, I tried these six different  

experiments and here's the experiment that 
was able to boost leads most successfully. And if you want to get these results, you can use HubSpot to do that  and that's how you make sure that when Chat GPT is sharing those insights it says to the user, "oh, and did you know you can get similar results with HubSpot."
Yeah. Yeah. You don't want it to work too hard,   right? If it has to make a connection between 
like a thought leadership post and then a product it's not going to make that connection and there's 
like tasteful ways to do it, right? I think   you and I go back and forth on like how hard is 
the promotion, what is the line? And it's just a   matter of like what's the angle? Can we make sure 
it's woven in naturally? Make sure the LLM and   the reader for that matter like knows, okay, I'm 
reading this education or this thought leadership   piece and it's brought to you by said brand or 
product, which I think is a nice way to tie it in.  

And speaking of what matters in AEO, we actually 
just did this study. So, we sent out a survey to   300 marketers to see how they are navigating the 
shift. Obviously, we are investing heavily here,   but we want to see how the industry is doing 
it. And the data is really interesting. 32%   are already seeing real traffic from AI search 
engines, and 57% are actively optimizing for   it. So, I think brands are actively trying to 
figure out how to be cited and drive people to   their site. So, if you're interested in how your 
AEO strategy compares to the industry benchmarks,   where the budgets are going, what content types 
people are investing in, what some of the biggest   challenges they're facing, we've put together a 
full breakdown for you in the survey results. You   can click the link in the description or scan 
the QR code and get it for free. Okay. Next,   you're going to add schema. And schema is it's 
like a language. And schema has actually been  

around for a long time. It's not a new thing for 
answer engines. And there's been some debate about   how much answer engines are actually relying 
on schema, but we know they're lazy readers.   And schema is like that quick hit. Here is exactly 
what's on the page. It's a description of what's   on the page. Uh users won't be able to see it. 
It's in the code. Yeah. And so you want to embed   relevant schema for whatever the page type is. 
You can use FAQ schema to say, "Hey, these are   questions. These are answers." You can use article type schema for your blog post to say, "this is an article." You can go to Schema.org to see all of the different schema types, but in technical terms go ham on the schema. Yeah, I think it's important too cuz 
we at least on the content side, right,   we're so focused on the content itself, the hook, 
the headline, the sub headline, all the content,   but making sure that it's structured and making 
sure those add as pieces is what's going to  

increase the discoverability for us. Like if 
we don't do that, uh, we're not going to get   the visibility we're looking for. If a tree falls 
in the forest and Chat GPT isn't there to hear it,   did it actually fall? Schema helps you make a 
noise. So, is schema the last thing I'm going   to do before I hit publish? Yeah, you're ready to 
publish. It is a lot to do. I actually don't think   it's more to do than we have been doing for search 
engines, right? Like back in the day when we were   both like learning SEO, you're talking about the 
keyword and the slug and the headline and the   intro and the like you have your checklist to make 
sure that that page is optimized. checklist. So,   we've broken down how to do it, who's doing it 
well, cuz like my feed, like I mentioned, is full   of people sharing their case studies, their crazy 
results, which I'm not sure I believe all of them.   You're right to be skeptical. Yeah, a little skeptical, 
but like your team's in this every single day.  

You're looking at what's working internally for 
us. You're looking at external in the market.   Like, who's doing this really well? I have to say, 
Kyle, I posted on LinkedIn asking for examples of   companies doing AEO in preparation for recording 
this, and it was it was crickets out there. There   are not a lot of companies who are doing it 
really well right now, if I can be totally   honest. And I think that's because there is 
a lot of confusion. There's a lot of ambiguity.   Few companies truly know what is helping you show 
up in results. Um, one company that I think is an   exception to this is Web Flow. And Web Flow has 
done a really nice job of building in public,   talking about their successes and their failures 
on their blog. They have put together some really   great content that I think is appealing for both 
users and answer engines, and that's hard to do.   As you've like reviewed their content, where where 
is that overlap? Like where are they focusing from  

a content strategy standpoint? I think a great 
example of content that I am positive is helping   them show up more in Chat GPT is their glossary. 
Okay, so their glossary is a compendium. It's an   SAT word for you. Love that. Uh I did get a good 
score on my SATs. That doesn't surprise me at all.   It's a compendium of terms that are relevant to 
their ICP. And what they do a really nice job of,   they have a really really well structured answer 
to every single glossary, really well structured   explanation. And the product mentions are so 
seamlessly integrated. It's chef's kiss. So are   you borrowing from them? Are you implementing new 
experiments? What's our team up to? We have also   done the glosary play. It wasn't necessarily 
inspired by Web Flow. I think the companies that   are leading in AO have hit on some of the same 
techniques maybe organically. Sure. So we have   a glossary of our own and this is all the 
concepts that are relevant to our ICP. You  

will see the product integrations throughout. 
Our glossary pages are a lot longer than Web   Flow's and that's because we want to provide as 
much relevant information to Chat GPT as possible.   We've also incorporated a lot of relevant 
documentation. So links to our knowledge base,   links to our product pages. And the idea is just 
hammer home over and over and over again this is   the connection between this highlevel concept. 
Yeah. And what product the product can actually   accomplish. Yeah. And you might say, well, what's 
the difference between SEO? Because we making   glossaries for SEO, too. Yeah. How how is this 
any different? And I think the big difference is   A. if someone shows up on the page, a real person, 
great. But the primary audience is an LLM. So,   we are building these pages with the expectation 
that few humans will ever land there. And the goal   is not to facilitate a direct conversion. is 
to get that information in Chat GPT so that that  

person understands how HubSpot can help them. Then 
they make their way to our website. They might go   directly to a demo page. They might sign up for 
the free product directly. And so the recipient,   the audience is different. There's a middle person 
or a middle bot now that they didn't used to be.   The LLMs are piecing that together for folks, 
right? They're able to get totally commodified   that type of content. So give it to them, 
but make sure you're making the connection to   the product so it works for you. Okay. Okay. So, 
should we quickly recap those seven best practices? It was a   lot. It was a lot. Let's go through all of them. 
All right. So, number one is answer up front.   That one that one I know our teams are trained on 
that. We need it. It's good for the user and it's   good for the LLM. It's like here's what the page 
is about. Don't bury the lead. The second piece   which we're I I think is just like added context. 
Be able to add additional details. Help the LLM  

understand what's this page about and like why. 
Show your math. Show your math. The third is the   one that I think we're most passionate about is 
just making sure it's original, right? Is like,   is the by line from somebody credible? Do I 
have original research? Do I have an example   that no one else can publish in the industry? 
Like bringing original content and thought,   especially because of those educational how-tos 
are so uh commodified at this point. Net new   information. That's what you're trying to provide. 
The next is making sure that that product link is   in there.  It's tough too because it's like 
not a direct promo. And I think you mentioned   that as well is like Web Flow does this well. 
I think we're starting to do it really well,   which is like what's the angle? How does it fit 
in? So making sure that you can teach the LLM,   hey, here's what this content is about and it's 
related to this product within our portfolio and  

just making that easy connection with that 
internal link. That's what ultimately gets   you the recommendations. So that one is key. Key 
last piece around like added content, I think, is   the FAQ part. like we just need to be able to get 
to those quick hit and answers. And I think like   as you have all that out, the last piece is like 
structurally is the page there. So, I'm going through my   checklist. I have my answers. I have my context. 
I'm uh working everything in, but making sure it's   broken up, making sure there's headlines, bullet 
points, certain modules so it's easy to tables,   things that are more uh structured and easy for 
those LLMs to get through. Mhm. Last but not   least is the schema markup. Critical. So having my 
schema markup in there before I hit publish. You   can add it after the fact. So if you forget, you 
can go back in. Okay. All right. We have reached   our final segment which is called The Last Word 
where we will have 30 seconds to convince you  

that our spicy hot marketing take is right. All 
right. You ready? I'm ready. You got 30 seconds.   I've got 30 seconds. All right. Let's go. Okay. 
Substack should stick to text. I've been getting   notifications. The creators that I'm following, they're going on live. They've been trying to introduce podcasts, videos. What they are good at is text and they need to double down on their value prop of text. Okay. No one wants video from   you. Substack. I agree. I'm going to YouTube for 
video. I'm going to YouTube video. I'm going to Instagram Tik Tak. Tik Tok. Substack. It's text. Well done. 
All right, Kyle. You ready with your last word?   Let's do it. All right, your mark. Get set. Go. 
All right. So, my last word is that consistency   is actually the invisible advantage. So, 
here here we've talked about this a lot,   but in my feed, I just keep getting the latest 
hack, the latest uh play, the latest tactic.   People are just trying a bunch of different 
things and just trying to see what sticks,  

but none of it's working cuz they're not giving it 
time to mature. Interesting. Over the last decade,   we perfected that playbook for search, but 
you had to be consistent week over week,   month over month, year over year. I think 
we're going to see the same thing with   the LLM. So stick to your structures and 
keep it consistent. You came in just over,   but I'll give it to you. All right. I appreciate 
it. All right. Thank you all so much for tuning   in. I'm Asia. And I'm Kyle. This is Field Notes, 
and we'll see you here next time. My takes today   would might be like very Miss Rachelesque, you 
know, with the little one. Straight to camera.

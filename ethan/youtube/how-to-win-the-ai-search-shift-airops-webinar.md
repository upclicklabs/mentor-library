# How to Win The AI Search Shift - AirOps Webinar with Ethan Smith and Alex Halliday

## Overview
AirOps hosted a webinar featuring Alex Halliday (AirOps CEO), Ethan Smith (Graphite CEO), and Josh Spilker (AirOps Content & SEO) discussing practical strategies for succeeding in AI search.

## Top Takeaways

### 1. Semantic Search Was the Original Shift; AI Is the Next Wave
Google's transition from exact-match to semantic search was transformative. AI represents the second major reset, compounding that trend rather than replacing it entirely.

### 2. AI Chat Interfaces Are New Visibility Gatekeepers
ChatGPT, Perplexity, Rufus, and Cursor now mediate buyer research. Visitors arrive deeper in the funnel, but visibility into research paths diminishes.

Key metrics:
- Webflow: ~8% of signups from AI chatbots
- Early B2B/developer tools: 8-10% range
- CPG brands: under 0.5%
- Average ChatGPT prompt: ~60 words, high-intent and purchase-primed

### 3. Questions, Not Keywords, Drive Content Strategy
User intent emerges from sales calls, support conversations, Reddit, and social platforms. Content teams must answer real questions directly while avoiding question stuffing.

Frontier questions - new inquiries emerging across support logs, Zendesk, Gong, and Reddit - require continuous tracking.

### 4. Content Must Be Structurally Quote-Friendly for LLMs
LLMs reward clarity and structure. Recommended approaches include question-based headers, bullet lists, tables, grouped FAQs, and basic schema.

Critical technical detail: JavaScript-rendered content remains invisible to LLMs. Foundational HTML is essential; JavaScript-based optimization tools provide no benefit for LLM answers.

### 5. Freshness Signals Increasingly Weighted in AI Answers
Models rely on recent credible information when accessing external data. Precision refreshes, updated statistics, and strong last updated practices ensure sustained visibility.

### 6. Third-Party Mentions Play Outsized Role in AEO
Top Google rankings are insufficient. LLMs seek multiple independent signals - Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, industry sites, partner channels, and PR placements influence citation decisions.

YouTube is particularly powerful, cited frequently in LLM responses across all product categories.

### 7. Controlled Experiments Define 2026 Winners
Teams should run prompt-level tests with control groups, experimenting with video embeds, FAQs, question headers, Reddit participation, or integrations. Track citation pickup and visibility shifts; if controls move, model changes not strategy success.

## Best Practices

Maintain SEO investment: SEO work works for free in AEO. Preserve domain authority and evergreen content; treat AEO as expansion, not replacement.

Build off-site authority: Relationships driving third-party citations now influence visibility. Target trusted domains by category and invest in YouTube and Reddit presence strategically.

Structure content for citation: Use clear headers, FAQs, and comprehensive information. Regular refreshes ensure accuracy and topicality.

Earn third-party mentions: Encourage authentic reviews, testimonials, and discussions across platforms. Track citation patterns and identify gaps.

Test continuously: Run controlled experiments tracking share of voice, citation quality, and domain influence across answer engines.

## Implementation Path

Success combines strong on-site content with off-site authority and experimental culture. Prioritize originality, refresh consistently, and expand reach across influential channels.

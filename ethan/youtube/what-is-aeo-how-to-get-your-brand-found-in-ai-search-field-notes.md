# What Is AEO? How to Get Your Brand Found in AI Search | Field Notes

Is traffic from ChatGPT going to overtake traffic 
from Google in 2028? That's what some people are   saying. I'm seeing it in the feeds. That's what 
Semrush is saying. Yeah. For us, it's a matter   of like how do you optimize for each? How do 
you figure out which one to prioritize? So, I'm   excited to jump into that today and like figure 
out, okay, how do we do this for both channels? Welcome to Field Notes. This is HubSpot's new show 
where we break down what's happening in marketing.   I'm Asia Frost, senior director of global growth 
and paid advertising at HubSpot. And I'm Kyle   Denhoff, senior director of content at HubSpot. 
And this topic is so important that we thought   we needed some reinforcements. So, we also brought 
in Mike King, founder and CEO of iPull Rank. Mike,   you actually just were awarded Search Engine 
Lands Marketer of the Year, right? Yeah,   for a second time, actually. For a second time. 
That's pretty darn cool. All right. To start off,  

I'd love to hear like in one sentence, how 
would you describe AEO? AEO is the art and   science of getting visibility in AI surfaces like 
ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, etc. And Mike,   when you're like working with clients or or uh 
speaking engagements, putting out the education,   if you're just getting started, cuz we've talked 
to small businesses, we've talked to some bigger   brands. they're all at like different maturity 
phases when it comes to getting started to showing   up in these LLMs. Like where where do they start? 
Definitely the first place to start is measuring   where you stand and then prioritizing the 
opportunities where you're not showing up. So, one   of the things that I often see as an opportunity 
is around branded terms, particularly related to   things like pricing, cuz you know, historically 
what you didn't want to do is have your pricing   on your website for some sorts of businesses. And 
so, what happens is you lose the opportunity to  

manage your brand message cuz then these tools are 
going out to thirdparty sources to figure out what   your pricing is. So any really important brand 
terms like that should be your place where you're   uh going after getting visibility just to get it 
started. Well, I'm really glad that you brought up   measurement because that's something that we care 
deeply about at HubSpot and we put our money where   our mouth is on that. We released AEO Grader back 
in March 2024. It's a free tool. Anyone can use   it. You don't have to be a HubSpot customer and 
it's now available in six languages. Yeah. You   can plug in your brand and it'll tell you exactly 
how you are showing up across all the major answer   engines relative to your competitors. We'll drop 
the link in the description so that folks can take   it for a spin, but it's a really powerful cool 
tool and I completely agree. It all starts with   understanding uh where you're strong and where 
you have gaps. Starting at that foundation,  

I think that's something we did as well. You had 
mentioned this like when we started out we did the   initial scan and got got that report card and 
started to see where we were falling short and   then uh what actions we wanted to take right away. 
So what were one of the things that like your team   was able to execute and see improvements from? 
Yeah, pricing is a really relevant example. We   did have a pricing page on our website but it's 
rendered with JavaScript. Google can understand   JavaScript. ChatGPT cannot. So it was really 
straightforward. We just published a series   of pricing blog posts on our blog. All the 
information that ChatGPT needed about all   of our features and how they were priced. And 
we saw pricing accuracy across all AI services   go up immediately and significantly. Yeah. And 
Mike, with your technical background, obviously,   uh, Aja mentioning the JavaScript, that's a big 
piece of this, doing our research, understanding  

where we're standing, but then making sure 
our content is structured in a way that it's   easy to understand. Can you walk through that 
a little bit for us like what's working what's   not working when it comes to creating content 
on page? So the first thing is just like Aja   said uh ChatGPT, Perplexity those platforms don't 
render JavaScript whereas Google and Bing do. So,   you know, making sure that it's accessible is the 
first thing. Then structuring the content is very   much like the things that we've done historically 
for SEO, like making sure you have clear headings,   making sure that you're using things like bullet 
points and tables and so on. And you want things   to be very structured in such a way where you 
have kind of like atomic units in your content.   And what I mean by that is you don't want to have 
a paragraph that's talking about like four or five   different things. You want a paragraph that is 
very specific to whatever the topic is on that  

because it's easier for a large language model to 
parse out that information and then use it as part   of the response. You also want to be using data 
points that are like very clear, ideally unique   ones to you as well. Like if you have a fact in 
your content that um is is supported by the other   facts that are corroborated, then they are going 
to use that because you're the only source for it.   The way that I always explain it to folks outside 
of the AEO SEO world is LLMs are very lazy readers.   If you just throw walls of text at an LLM, if you 
throw a bunch of different ideas in one section,   the chances of it pulling that information go 
way down. And so you need to make it as clear to   read as possible. One thing I'm interested in is 
like what are some things maybe that we've tested   um that aren't working? So, Mike, are there 
any things that you've done um when it comes   to a content strategy, a content type, a content 
format on a page where we thought it was going  

to get the results um and get the citations 
but just didn't end up happening for you? So,   it's not really that. It's more that things 
that work really well for um classic SEO,   okay, that don't work as well in the LLM 
environment. So, as an example, a thing that like   uh typically works quite well for Google search 
is removing a meta description entirely because   then Google will surface whatever copy's most 
relevant to the query and then there's a higher   click-through rate from the user because 
of that. But in the chat GBT environment,   it actually works better if your meta description 
kind of spoils what the answer is on the page. So,   you would think like, oh, because this worked well 
for classic SEO, it should also work on this side,   but no, they actually really value the meta
description. Yeah, we uh we talk about that,   too. You want to put the answer first. No bearing 
the lead when you're trying to cater to an LLM.  

Speaking of off-site, I think off-site is a huge 
part of any brand's successful AEO strategy.   Similar question as the one Kyle asked. Mike, 
what have you seen working? What have you seen   be less successful? I mean, Reddit is is what's 
working like gang busters. Um, and then there's   also the aspect of link building that think that 
people keep trying to figure out where like what   to do here. And it's far more about relevance 
at this point than it is about volume. So,   that's one of the things I tell people that not 
focus on so much anymore, like, oh, how do I get   a 1000 links? Like, no. really focus on getting 
five to 10 really high quality links that are   um very relevant to the subject matter 
that your site is covering. Yeah. Oh,   there was so much that you just said that I want 
to dig into. I want to hear how you are leveraging   Reddit for iPullRank itself or maybe iPullRank 
clients. As far as what we do for our clients,  

it's mostly helping them build out a strategy. In 
some cases, it's identifying the right, you know,   threads for them to be a part of. Some of it's 
like what subreddits do we want to help them get   really involved in? And in some cases, a brand may 
stand up their own subreddit. But all of that is   like, you know, it's going to be a function of 
community management. Like, you got to be smart   about it. You can't just be jumping into threads 
and being like, "We're the best ever." You know,   you got to be a lot more thoughtful and strategic 
on that. Yeah. That's what I love about Reddit.   It is so allergic to inauthentic promotion and it 
it means you're exactly right, you have to engage   really thoughtfully. One interesting thing, 
obviously this isn't going to work for every   brand, but what we've seen is when engagement 
or participation on HubSpot's subreddit goes up,   then positive mentions of HubSpot go up across 
Reddit, so within all the communities that we  

are not actively moderating. And so we've actually 
really focused on making the HubSpot subreddit a   really great place to hang out because we see 
ripple effects across the ecosystem. Mike, you   also when we were talking earlier mentioned like 
the digital PR component, getting the mentions,   the brand mentions over the links. How do 
you think about that for your clients is like   there's the own structure on site, there's 
off-site that you control, and then there's   things you're pitching and trying to to get more 
value from. How do how do you structure that for   your clients? Yeah, absolutely. So, again, because 
we're trying to create consensus across the web,   we're been getting really clear on like what those 
messages need to be. And so, we're working with   the digital PR teams or we're doing the digital PR 
ourselves and pitching those messages as part of,   you know, whatever content we're trying to get out 
there. So, if it's the sort of thing where it's  

like a data point that we want to make sure we get 
in there, we want to make sure that we have that   highlighted highly in the pitch and you may want 
to have some content assets to support it or what   have you. But the whole point is that you want to 
get that message in as many places as possible.   And also to that point, I think we're seeing, you 
know, some of those older tactics come back in   that same vein. like we're starting to see more 
people say like, "Hey, maybe we should create a   micro site on this subject as well so that we have 
more opportunity to control that message across   the web." We've uh we've been dabbling in some 
microsites. Dabbling in some micro sites. Yeah, more   to come. More more to come on micro sites. The 
one thing I want to dive in there, you mentioned   like the stat and the message. I think that's like 
really important. How do you do you want to carry   that stat or message across all the touch points 
we've been talking about today? The way I I think  

about how this stuff works is it's like a raffle 
and you're creating as many raffle tickets as   possible across the web so that you can win that 
raffle. And so there are basically these campaigns   where we're like, okay, let's make sure that 
we just have this one idea in multiple places.   And so it may be worded slightly different or it 
may use the same literal statistic in in all the   different pitching and in the community management 
work but the whole point is that yes we are trying   to create that consensus across as many surfaces 
as possible so that you know when ChatGPT goes   out and it's it's doing all its like synthetic 
queries and all that it keeps running into that   stat. I think that's like an easy way for not easy 
but one way for anyone a straightforward way for   folks who are getting started right yeah it's like 
where do I show up what are those messages data   points that are critical and then how do I have 
that consistently across the web and if I could  

just tie together in a bow I think several of the 
concepts that we've been talking about we said   it's really important to start with measurement 
understand where you're showing up and where you   are not you can use AEO Grader to do that again 
you can uh click the link in our description to   check out AEO Grader. Once you have that idea of 
your visibility gaps, that's when you're going   to develop your strategy. And that strategy, as 
we've talked about, it's going to be both onsite,   the content that you create and you own, and 
it's going to be offsite. And repetition of that   concept is going to be really important across 
all of those places that we know AI is going and   training and citing. And I think a challenge, and 
we've we've faced this at HubSpot even, is just   the alignment of all these channels to like work 
behind the same strategy. I think like as you grow   and scale folks are implementing things that work 
on their channel are native for their channel but  

it's actually can we get aligned on the content 
strategy the foundation the message and then   execute against that. No I just want to say I 
agree with that like people more look at genative   AI and AI search as like a technical problem. It 
is more a content strategy problem than anything   else. Yes. Thank you. I love that. Yeah. That is 
a great segue because Mike, we really want to pick   your brain for a segment that we call The Last 
Word. This is where we share our sometimes spicy,   sometimes controversial takes on anything in 
marketing. I think Kyle, you should go first.   You get 30 seconds. That's the That's the game. 
30 seconds to say your case. Okay. All right,   Kyle, tell me when you're ready. All right, let's 
do it. Okay, go. All right. So, my last word is   marketing teams need to optimize for the overlap. 
Today we've talked a lot about all the different   channels you need to show up on and we jump 
into like channel tactics all the time like what  

content am I going to publish to these channels 
but it's actually just as important to understand   where's your audience spending their time. So 
when we say optimize for the overlap it's like   what are the two or three channels my audience 
spends time on and the two or three channels   that the LLMs are sourcing. That's really where we 
want to start our foundation from. Perfection. You   nailed it. Love that. And I also completely agree. 
Most teams, including ours, have finite resources,   finite budget. So if it's not playing two for one, 
shouldn't be in the mix. My turn. All right. You   ready? Yeah. Go. Okay. We need to stop saying "this 
channel is dead" about any channel. I remember   talking to my boss six or seven years ago pitching 
an email newsletter for HubSpot and she's like,   "Eh, newsletter is dying." Damn, I wish I hadn't 
listened to her. Email's alive and well. Email's   alive and well. I guarantee you. Yes, sure, some 
channels are getting harder, but there is always  

an exception to a rule. If you have a really good 
concept for a channel, if your audience is there,   you can find a way to make it work. And by 
saying, "This channel is dying or this channel is   dead," you give up before you've even started. 
Ooh, close. Close. 31. 31. Strike the last few   words from the record. Do you agree, Mike? I agree 
wholeheartedly. Yeah. I've made more money off of   email marketing than I have on like anything 
else. So, yeah. Well, there you go. There it   is. Yeah. All right. You ready for the last 
word, Mike? Let's get it. Bring up my timer.   Okay. And go. It is a profound mistake to say that 
optimizing for generative AI is just SEO. Uh, from   a straightup business perspective, you know, all 
the business people that are hearing you say that   are thinking that you don't understand business 
and you're going to miss out on opportunities for   yourself. Well, that was 19 putting us to shame. 
I think that's exactly right. I think you can tell  

from our conversation today that a successful AEO 
strategy involves a ton of different components   across the business. I think it requires buy in 
from the top down 100%. Like you need all sorts   of other um teams to really weigh in with you 
and even if the tactics are similar right now,   they will not be long term. So it's a really silly 
thing to be like, oh, it's just SEO and put it in   that box. Well, I think that's something that we 
wholeheartedly believe which you can see by uh how   much we've been talking about AEO at HubSpot. AEO 
is part of the new Loop Marketing framework that   uh HubSpot has also been talking a lot about. 
It's part of the Amplify phase of this four stage   playbook. Yeah, it's I mean it's critical for 
reaching audiences at this point, right? It has   to be part of the mix. Mike, it has been such a 
blast talking with you. You dropped so many gems.   This has been Field Notes, the new show where we 
break down what's happening in marketing. I'm Aja  

Frost. And I'm Kyle Denhoff. We'll see you next 
time. Should we do like a sales summer house? Oh   my god, that would actually be amazing. I mean, 
it would be like a potential legal nightmare.

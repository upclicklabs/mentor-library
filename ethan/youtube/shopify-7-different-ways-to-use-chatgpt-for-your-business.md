hey guys what's up welcome back if you're new here my name is Michelle Bailey I'm a creative strategist and I'm also your host for today's video and if you guys are super new here and you've never watched any of our videos from this channel what's up this is learn with Shopify this is an official Shopify YouTube tutorial Channel where we give easy to follow step-by-step tutorials for entrepreneurs of all levels so welcome to the crew and make sure that you are subscribing if that does sound good to you and hit that notification Bell because we drop a new video every week I'm going to explain what Chachi BT is and how to get logged onto it so if you already know this feel free to just use the timestamp in the description box to skip ahead but first what is chat gbt so Chachi BT is a chat bot that uses AI to understand humans and spit out human-like responses and what makes this tool so useful is it operates on generative AI meaning that Chachi BT can actually generate new content rather than let's say Google which is just ref referencing existing content from the web so for example you can get it to solve math problems you can get it to write code explain a complex Concept in depth summarize books paraphrase articles write blog posts write short video scripts and just so much more and what makes it so special is it doesn't feel like you're talking to a bot from its launch Chachi BT gained over a million users in the span of five days and guys this growth is absolutely unheard of to compare platforms to gain the same amount of users it took Facebook 10 months it took Twitter 24 months and Netflix 3.5 years that's a lot so in case you haven't already let me show you how you can sign up to get started with this how to use chai gbt so if you go to chat.openai.com It'll ask you to create a free account and once you do you'll be taken to a chat bot here is where you can ask it to perform those tasks and answer questions for you and that's it

alright now let me show you what it can do for your business level up your spreadsheet productivity Chachi BT can make very tedious tasks within Excel or Google Sheets a lot quicker and more painless it not only can do things for you so if you've ever been looking at a spreadsheet and you know exactly what it is you need to do but you just don't know how to do it Chachi PT can quickly teach you how to do it so check this out let's say you have a list of customers and their first and last names are in a single cell but you want to separate these cells you can type into Chachi BT and ask it how do I separate a first and last name into two separate cells in Excel and this is the answer that it gave me so that's really good but I actually wanted a formula for how to do this really quickly and easily so the nice thing about Chachi PT is that it remembers our conversation in that same chat so now I can have a conversation with it so now I'm going to ask if it can give me a formula for this and look it gave me a formula that I can now easily plug into Excel the nice thing about this that Google doesn't have is that it generates creates an accurate response within 10 seconds or less and I don't have time to search the internet to get a definitive answer so this is just one of the ways that you can use Chachi BT to help you make your life in spreadsheets just go a lot smoother so let me know some useful prompts or Excel you discovered using chachypt in the comment section below

you can write a job description so whether you want to hire someone to join your team full time or maybe you just need a quick freelancer from upwork you're going to need a job description so I want to ask Chachi PT to write me a professional and friendly job description with some of my requirements and in a matter of seconds look how detailed this is guys this saved me a lot of time of thinking of how I can word my sentences and how to make it sound super professional and now I have a job description that's tailored to my needs and that I can quickly edit

you can write content in multiple different languages so if you're selling products or Services internationally you're going to need your Communications in different languages whether you're writing a product description or a marketing email chatgpt can not only translate it into any language but it can also create it for you from scratch right so let's do this for an example let's pretend I wanted to create an about us page on my website I'm going to ask Chachi BT to create a 90 word statement about my mattress brand that focuses on sustainability I'll give it a few details about my company so that it has something to work with and guys look what it spits out this is ready for me to copy and paste onto my about us page on my website now I'm going to tell it to translate the statement for my Spanish-speaking customers and look how perfect and seamless this was

write in debug code if you're running a business and you have a website or an e-commerce store at some point you're going to be faced with having to write some code and having the skill is extremely helpful to make custom edits to your site but not everyone is a coder right so if you're a total beginner you can ask Chachi BT how to write code from JavaScript to Python and if ever you have a piece of code that is broken instead of taking hours to find that error chatgpt can actually point out where that error is for you

create lead magnets in our most recent video Sylvia Langley left a comment asking how to create a lead magnet using chat gbt hi Sylvia and by the way guys if you do want to see any use cases of Chachi BT that I haven't mentioned here you can just leave it in the comments section down below just like Sylvia did but yeah I feel like this question is an amazing question Sylvia so for anyone that has never heard of a lead magnet and what that is lead magnets are useful resources that can be easily and freely accessed by prospective customers the point of them is to use them as a hook to attract new customers so for example you could create a free downloadable booklet and make it available for users on your Shopify site right it would have your branding it would have your website email or even phone number so that once this prospective customer is done using this amazing awesome free resource the next logical step is to get in touch with you hence the name lead magnet right so Sylvia asks how to make a free downloadable booklet and that is exactly what we're going to use chatg to do let's pretend I have a nutrition business we're going to use Chachi BT to help us write a booklet with meals for an entire week all under 800 calories I could see this being really useful for anyone that's trying to stay healthy and I might even put some recipes in there that could include some of my products that's just one example but you could do content just like this from Fitness to food to fashion and gardening and so much more

use chat gbt to negotiate tactfully in business negotiations will just be a part of your day-to-day life but it's common to feel kind of clouded by emotion and to be able to negotiate tactfully when that happens so you can leverage chat gbt to come up with strategic and rational responses so check this out I said I'm negotiating with a supplier who wants to sell me their units at two dollars but I can only afford one dollar per unit how can I strategically respectfully and tactfully negotiate and it came back with essentially the most clear and concise crash course I've ever seen on the important principles of negotiation and I was like okay now write me an email responding back to the supplier and this is what it answered so now I can literally copy and paste this and send it off if I wanted to so that's super useful

you can use chat EBT to write email marketing content so some people have a knack for writing catchy and very cool marketing content and then some of us just aren't wired that way but the good news is that Chachi T can help you write your next email to help you sell your products or services so let's go over to chatgpt to see just how I'm going to say write me a two sentence paragraph that advertises that my Japanese denim brand is having a 20 off sale I also wanted to write me some fine print including dates and exceptions to this sale and here's what it gave me and guys I can put this in the bottom of my email now I'm going to ask it to write me a subject line and a preview text as well and so now that I have all this I can head over to MailChimp or clayview or whatever email service provider that I'm using and copy and paste this text easy as that this email is only halfway done though we still need imagery so if you don't have imagery and you actually want to use AI to generate imagery for you I urge you to check out this video right over here this is how to use Dolly to generate branded imagery without ever having to pick up a camera email marketing is an invaluable tool to generate sales whether you have three active customers or 300 000 active customers and Chachi BT can help you nail those Communications every single time

# AEO vs. GEO vs. AI SEO

## Introduction

The article explores three competing terms for optimizing brand presence in large language models (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Meta AI). The name of a concept and the definition of it are determined by a group of people reaching a collective agreement, making linguistic alignment important for industry development.

Three marketing leaders present competing arguments:

## Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

**Ethan Smith (Graphite CEO)** advocates for AEO because:
- "Answers" precisely describes LLM responses, unlike "generative" which encompasses images and video
- The term has no existing associations; searches for "best AEO agencies" return relevant results
- While AI generates diverse content, LLM products such as ChatGPT focus on chat, and chat primarily provides answers
- GEO confuses audiences due to geospatial technology associations
- AI SEO implies search is the only function, when LLMs serve broader conversational purposes

## Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

**Alan Yao (AthenaHQ Co-Founder)** supports GEO because:
- Modern systems do far more than answer — they plan, route, call functions, and now even transact
- AEO bakes one vendor's positioning into the field name
- GEO is vendor-neutral and future-proof as agentic capabilities expand
- The term better reflects that success means getting the engine to select your tool

## AI SEO

**Tomasz Niezgoda (Surfer CMO)** champions AI SEO because:
- It shows a clear evolution of our discipline
- The term leverages existing SEO brand equity while signaling advancement
- LLMs function as wrappers for search, maintaining continuity with traditional optimization
- The acronym avoids forced constructions like AISO

## AI Systems Weigh In

**ChatGPT** favors GEO as future-proof.

**Perplexity** chooses AI SEO based on market demand (250,000+ monthly searches versus 1,300 for GEO).

**Google Gemini** supports AEO for clarity and seamless continuity with existing search marketing practices.

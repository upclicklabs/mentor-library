## Claude Opus 4.6 - Product Overview

Claude Opus 4.6 represents Anthropic's most advanced model, described as a hybrid reasoning model that pushes the frontier for coding and AI agents, featuring a 1M context window. The model was announced on February 5, 2026.

## Key Capabilities

**Advanced Coding**: Delivers production-ready code with minimal oversight. The system plans carefully, maintains effort over extended sessions, and operates reliably in larger codebases. It demonstrates strong code review and debugging abilities to catch its own mistakes.

**AI Agents**: Makes agents meaningfully more useful by handling longer, complex task chains with fewer errors. It adapts its approach as conditions change and excels at complex, multi-step agentic workflows.

**Enterprise Workflows**: Brings consistency to high-stakes work, maintaining context and quality across large projects. Performs well on document work, spreadsheets, presentations, financial analyses, research, and chart interpretation.

## Availability and Pricing

Available on Claude for Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise users. Developers can access it via the Claude Developer Platform, Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Vertex AI, and Microsoft Foundry.

Pricing starts at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens. Cost savings available through prompt caching (up to 90%) and batch processing (50% savings). US-only inference available at 1.1x pricing.

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Terminal-Bench 2.0**: 65.4% (industry-leading on agentic coding evaluation)
- **OSWorld**: 72.7% (best computer-using model performance)
- **MRCR v2** (8-needle 1M variant): 76% accuracy on long-context retrieval
- **GDPval-AA**: Outperforms GPT-5.2 by approximately 144 Elo points
- **Long-context performance**: Significantly reduced "context rot" compared to predecessors

## Notable Features

**New Capabilities**:
- Agent teams in Claude Code for parallel task execution
- Compaction feature for summarizing context in long-running tasks
- Adaptive thinking that adjusts extended thinking based on contextual clues
- Effort controls for developers to balance intelligence, speed, and cost

**Product Integrations**:
- Claude in Excel (substantial upgrades)
- Claude in PowerPoint (research preview)
- Cowork for autonomous multitasking

## Safety and Trust

Extensive testing conducted with external experts ensures the model meets Anthropic's standards for safety, security, and reliability. The accompanying system card documents safety results comprehensively.
